§ MEDIUM: Might occur at some time
§ LOW: Could occur but not expected
§ UNLIKELY: May occur only in exceptional circumstances
o RISK MATRIX: Combines likelihood and consequence
o LEGEND: E=extreme risk (immediate action), 
H=high risk (senior management attention), 
M=moderate risk (specify management responsibility), 
L=low risk (routine procedures)
· QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS: Uses numerical values
o ASSET VALUE (AV): Value of asset (monetary)
o EXPOSURE FACTOR (EF): Percentage of asset value lost in incident
o SINGLE LOSS EXPECTANCY (SLE): AV × EF
o ANNUALIZED RATE OF OCCURRENCE (ARO): Expected frequency per year

o E.G.: Server worth $50,000 w/ 30% damage expected from incident that occurs once every 5yrs
§ AV = $50,000
§ EF = 30% = 0.3
§ SLE = $50,000 × 0.3 = $15,000
§ ARO = 1/5 = 0.2
§ ALE = $15,000 × 0.2 = $3,000
