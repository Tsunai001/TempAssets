How is personal information obtained?
• Directly
- You may have provided your name, DOB, address, ... to an organisation
• Indirectly - through your use of information systems or devices
- Examples:
• Web browsing history, Search history, Transaction history
• Applications, wearable health devices, ...
• Use of 'smart' devices - Smart TV, Home assistants, Smart lightbulbs
• Inferred from other data, or aggregation of multiple data items
- For example, location monitoring, combining search and browser histories
• Lots of ways personal information can be used/misused that compromise privacy

Threats to privacy

• People and their actions
- Consider both accidental and deliberate actions by people, including
• Within organisations (insiders)
- Employees (Information users)
- Employers (Management)
• External to organisations
- May have gained access (criminals motivated by financial gain, hacktivists, etc)
- Family and friends: sharing your info
- Governments

People - Human error

• Insecure disposal of medical letters
- Unauthorised disclosure of patient details
- April 2017
• Source: Confidential hospital patient records found dumped in Sydney bin - ABC News

People - human error (accidental)
• Social media use and accidental data disclosure
- Tony Abbott - boarding pass mistake - September 2020



• Optus cyber attack - September 2022, 10 million customers data stolen
• Optus: How a massive data breach has exposed Australia - BBC News
• 


• Cupid Media database hacked in 2013, 42 million records exposed
• http://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/11/cupid-media-hack-exposed-42m-passwords/comment-page-1/
• Personal information of users exposed + Cupid Media protection for stored data - reasonable measures?



People - deliberate action - within organisation
• Management
• Make decisions/policy on
- Personal information to collect
• What should be collected & what business process uses it?
• How is information collected?
- How that information will be treated through its lifecycle
• How could/should it be used?
• How long will it be kept?
- Who will have access to it, and how will that be managed
• Will it be shared with third parties?
- What happens at the end of the life stage - disposal?
• Do users/clients/customers know what is happening?

Example - Pareto Phone Breach - 2023
Multiple Australian charities have had donor information leaked onto the dark web. Here's what we know - ABC News



People - deliberate action - within organisation
• Management
• Make decisions/policy on info to collect
- Example: Monitoring/surveillance
• Common reasons for surveillance are
- performance evaluation (employee efficiency)
- compliance with federal and local laws
- protection against legal liability, and
- cost control/effective use of resources
" For example, phone and internet usage
" People in physical places/transportation
- When is monitoring reasonable?
- How could/should this information be used? Could it be misused?

Privacy and surveillance
• Surveillance
- Definition:
• 'the careful watching of someone, especially by an organization such as the police or the army.'
- Collins Dictionary
• 'The systematic investigation or monitoring of the
actions or communications of one or more persons.'
- Roger Clarke
• Stop and think!
- With the increasing use of technology, which organizations may be
able to watch (or listen to) you, or monitor your actions?
• Government organizations?
• Private companies?
- What can be observed/listened to?
- How would you know if this is happening?

Benefits of monitoring & surveillance

• Understand what is happening, identify issues and resolve them efficiently
- Example: Smart city
• Make use of CCTV, IoT, sensors to monitor temperature, air quality,
water, traffic flow
• Improved physical safety in public areas
• Direct law enforcement/emergencies services to incidents
• Efficient use of resources - manage traffic flows, divert from accidents and bottlenecks
• Improved environmental conditions - use climate control
• Connected neighbourhoods
- Example: Network monitoring
• Know when components are functioning or failing
• Identify traffic flow issues
• Detect abnormal behaviour that may indicate attack on system

Technology and data gathering by organizations

• Who gains access to data associated with ...
- Internet use
• For information exchange, for networking, for transactions (shopping, banking, ...)
- Mobile device use
• May provide location information (GPS, or approx location from WiFi or cellular signal)
• And mobile applications?
- Social media use
• What personal information is requested, what is provided, what can
be inferred?
- Internet of Things (IoT devices)
• Smart home devices - home assistance, automation, fridges, televisions, light bulbs, ..
• Smart cities - CCTV, parking monitoring, number-plate recognition, ...

Technology, data gathering and surveillance
Location monitoring
• Example - Uber, 2016
• https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2016/12/01/uber-now-collecting-location-data-even-after-you-leave-a-drivers-car/

Technology, data gathering and surveillance

• Who can see where you are?
• Web cameras compromised
• Australian security cameras hacked, streamed on a Russian-based website - ABC News


• Government surveillance
- May monitor personal data, location information and
communications 'in the national interest'
• Example: COVID location track and trace in 2020, 2021
- In Australia: general monitoring of calls is not permitted
• Federal Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979
- Some exceptions (where law enforcement have warrant)
• December 2018 - Telecommunications and Other Legislation Amendment (Assistance and Access) Act 2018 (Cth)
- Similar position in the US
• But mass surveillance of communications by NSA & phone
companies reported (June 2013 Edward Snowden)
• PRISM: NSA collected data from major internet companies Microsoft, Google, Facebook, etc



• Government surveillance in Australia
- Privacy Act covers most Australian government agencies; including AFP, Border and Crim Trac
- But some are not covered
• Office of National Assessments
• ASIO, ASIS, ASD
• Defence Intelligence Organisation
• Australian Geospatial Intelligence Org
- Inspector General of Intelligence and Security responsible
for oversight of these agencies' activities



• Technology
- It's possible to collect, store & process large amounts of info
- Many useful tools for monitoring and harvesting specific personal data
- Some data examples
• Phone calls - aside from the actual call, metadata includes number dialled, location data, time and duration of calls
- Mobile phone location (GPS, cell tower triangulation) reveals person location
• Internet access - URLs visited, time spent, site visited previously
• Social media - contents of posts, facial recognition for image data, network of friends/contacts, frequency of messaging
• Email - sent, recipient, content of email
• Keystroke logging - hardware and software keystroke loggers
- What is captured?


• Technology
- Location data can be obtained for mobile device users
- Lots of apps request location data and monitor locations
• Some apps need to know device location to provide their function
- Examples: Maps, Wayfinders, 'Find my ...'
• Other apps request it because they can monetize it
- Examples: Provide ads for services near the location, understand your interests to manage marketing, social media to learn about you and your connections
• Q: What have you enabled location tracking on? Is it needed?
- Some organizations will track employee location
• Can be for improved customer service (let customer know ETA)
• Can be for employee safety in case of emergency
• Provides understanding of resource deployment
- Many health wearables track location


• Monitoring device user activity: keystroke logger
- Hardware
• Examples: KeyGhost, Keyshark, KeyGrabber
- https://www.keelog.com/usb-keylogger
• Records keystrokes, up to 16,000,000
- Software
• Examples: Stealth Keylogger, Spector Pro
- Software products that cost less than US$100
• Logged data can be
- stored on computer for later retrieval, or
- transmitted to remote location
- Note: some trojans install software keyloggers on your PC without you
or your employer's consent, forward the recorded information to others

• Monitoring internet use: Cookies
- Cookies are small text files
• Initially sent from a web server to a web browser
• Then from browser back to server on subsequent visits
• Example:
• GSPID=0e755d775574d1cescholar.google.com.au/154727188783363
2111743328442790830060602*
- Use to store personal info or unique identifying fields
• login name, shopping cart information, location information
- Keep 'state' when browsing pages on a site or 'personalise'
web sites to correspond to user preferences



• Monitoring internet use: Cookies
- Cookies can be
• persistent (stored on browser machine hard drive) or
• non-persistent (in memory for that particular session only)

- Persistent cookies can be set to be valid for many years

- Users may disable cookies, or delete them, although some services will be degraded

- Some applications set cookies that actively resist deletion:
'evercookies'



• Monitoring internet use: Cookies
- Third party data analytics companies and advertising providers also use cookies
• to 'target' ads (send you ads for things you are likely to
be interested in)
• to serve different ads to the same user (rather than repeating the same ad)
• to measure
- how many unique users see a particular ad, and
- from which web site the ad was seen


• Monitoring internet use: Cookies
- When multiple sites use the same third-party service providers, those third-party cookies can be used to track browsing behaviour
• Example: Doubleclick.net, googleads
• Can lead to profiling person's interests & on-line behaviour - without their knowledge or consent?
• Under GDPR consent is required to collect PI data and the purpose for collection must be disclosed
- Sites that anticipate EU use will let you know cookies are being used, and the purpose, and ask for your consent
- Explore your options before consenting




• Monitoring internet use: Cookies
• Example: Kahoot!

• Look into the Cookies setting options:




2025	IFB240	32


• Alternative to cookies: browser fingerprinting
- Collected info about devices and browsers is enough to distinguish between users
• Browser type and version
• Plugins
• Customized settings
- Timezone
- Language
• Screen resolution
- Users can't delete this
- Electronic Frontier foundation provide a tool to test how identifiable your browser is: 'Cover your Tracks' available here: https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/


• Monitoring internet use: Web bugs
• Also called web beacons, page tags, pixel tags ...
- Used to keep track of which users view web pages or read email messages, and when
- Do this by including content
• such as a graphic (the bug)
that must be retrieved from another server to construct the page or message
• Could be single pixel, or small company image
- For the message or page to be displayed, a request is sent to this server
• Request includes details such as IP address of requesting
computer, time of request, type of web browser, ...

• Monitoring internet use: Web bugs
- When viewing a web page, check out where the page content is from:
• Using Safari choose: Develop -> Web Inspector -> Resources -> Images
• Using MS-IE choose: View -> Webpage Privacy Policy
• Using MS-Edge click padlock, then Cookies and Site Data, Or CTRL-U




• Data aggregation and data mining
- Used to develop a detailed profile of an individual's
• interests
• movements
• economic status and
• demographics
- Process is largely invisible for consumers
- Lots of small pieces of personal information can add up to much more detail than a person is comfortable disclosing
• Individuals may feel that it violates their privacy


• Check privacy policy for org's to see what they collect*
• Example: Google Privacy Policy - Privacy & Terms - Google





• Example: Google Privacy Policy - Privacy & Terms - Google







• Example: Google Privacy Policy - Privacy & Terms - Google


• Example: TikTok
- Do users know what information is being gathered?
- How is the information used?
- Is it needed for the
operation of the app?
- Why is it being collected?

Summary
• Information is an important asset
- Includes personal data that can be used to identify individuals
- How much control do you have over how your PII is collected,
stored and used?
• People and technology impact on information privacy
- How much personal information do you disclose ...
• Voluntarily
• Accidentally
• Without being aware of it
- If a service is 'free' you may be paying in a different way - by giving access to your data
• For example, free apps on mobile devices
• Read privacy policies and think about the implications before accepting terms and conditions
- Did you give consent? - For what?
- Does the organization act in accordance with the privacy policy?
