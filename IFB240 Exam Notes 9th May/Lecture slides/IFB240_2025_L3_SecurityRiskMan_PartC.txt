• Info Security Standards discussed in earlier lecture segments
– Part A: AS/NZS 27005:2024
– Part B: AS/NZS 27001:2023

• Part C is an overview of
– AS/NZS 27002:2022 Information security, cybersecurity and privacy protection Information security controls
– Same as international standard ISO/IEC 27002:2022
• An internationally recognised generic information security standard
– Supersedes AS/NZS 17799:2001, AS/NZS 27002:2006, AS/NZS 27002:2015
• AS27002:2022 published in October 2022

• Objective “… to provide a reference set of generic information security
controls including implementation guidance.”
• Designed to be used by organizations:
– Within the context of an ISMS based on AS/ISO/IEC 27001
– For implementing information security controls based on internationally
recognised best practices; and
– For developing organization-specific information management guidelines

Summary

• Cyber/Info security management is an exercise in controlling
risk - Should be a controlled process, not ad-hoc
• Standards provide guidelines on best practice
– ISO 27K series and NIST CSF are widely used
– Australian info sec standards you should know

• AS/NZS 27005:2024 Information Security Risk Management
• AS/NZS 27001:2023 Information Security Management Systems Requirements
– Compliance with this standard - need to implement all clauses
• AS/NZS 27002:2022 Information security, cybersecurity and privacy
protection - Information security controls
– Select clauses for controls relevant to your organisation
– Useful guidance for individuals as well as organisations

• There are other standards and useful guidelines
– Some are risk-based, some are compliance-based

• For meaningful security conversations with others, you
should know what info security is based on in their
organisation – do you have the same foundations?
