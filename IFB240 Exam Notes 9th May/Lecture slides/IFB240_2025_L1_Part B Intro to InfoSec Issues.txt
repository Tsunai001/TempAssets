Fundamental concepts:
Threats and Vulnerabilities
• Wondering how certain information assets can
be harmed?
• Analyse this by considering
– Threats
• Sets of circumstances with the potential to cause harm by
compromising stated security goals

– Vulnerabilities
• Characteristics of, or weaknesses in a system that could
be used to cause harm if acted on by a threat

–.

How can information assets
be harmed?
Personal example: laptop
Threat
• Theft of computing assets (laptop)
• Impact on security goal:
– Breach of availability
– Maybe subsequently breach
of confidentiality
Vulnerability
• Poor physical security of site
containing asset
•

How can information assets be harmed?
• Workplace example: customer information
– Threat
• Unauthorised disclosure of customer personal
information
– Vulnerability
• Disposal or re-use of storage media without
proper erasure

Fundamental concepts
Cyber/Info Security Incidents
• A security incident or event occurs when threats and
vulnerabilities coincide
– The threat acts on the vulnerability, resulting in harm to the
information asset

• Australian Cyber Security Centre definition:
– ‘An unwanted or unexpected cyber security event, or a series of
such events, that have a significant probability of compromising
business operations.’
–

ACSC quote source: https://www.cyber.gov.au/learn-basics/view-resources/glossary

• Means you need to know about
– The business operations
– The information assets associated with business operations
– Events that may (with some probability) compromise operations

Fundamental concepts
Incidents and Attacks
• A security incident is referred to as an attack if
the vulnerabilities are deliberately exploited
– That is, there is an intention to cause harm

• Refer to the person intentionally causing harm
as an attacker
– also called threat actor, malicious actor or adversary
• NOTE: Serious security incidents can result from non-deliberate
acts, so they must also be considered in cyber security assessments

Threat

Vulnerability
Poor physical security of site containing asset
Example - unlocked window of house

Security incident or attack?
Burglary (Burglar intentionally exploits
vulnerability to steal asset)
Example - Thief pushes unlocked window
open, reaches in and steals laptop

How can information assets be harmed?
• Workplace example
– Threat
• Unauthorised disclosure of customer personal information

– Vulnerability
• Disposal or re-use of storage media without proper erasure

– Security incident or attack?
• Persons without authorisation to
– access the software or
– view the data files on that storage media
may be able to do so, if they discover the presence
• Q: Was there intent to cause harm?

How can information assets be harmed?
Threats, Vulnerabilities and Attacks
• QUT example
– Threat
• External weather event causing
asset damage – breach of
availability

– Vulnerability
• Physical location of asset
• For example, in flood prone area

– Security incident or attack?
• Flood causing damage to property,
affecting information assets
• Example: Flood damage at QUT in
February 2022

incidents from non-deliberate acts?

Fundamental concepts

Information states
• Three information states
– In storage
• Storage containers can be electronic, physical, human
– In transmission
• Physical or electronic
– Being processed (in use)
• Physical or electronic, manual or automated

• Knowing the state the information is in is important for
understanding
– Potential threats to information
– Vulnerabilities in cyber/information systems, and
– Protective measures that can be applied

Fundamental Concepts - Controls
• Controls (also called security measures or countermeasures)
– Used to protect information assets or business goals by
countering threats or reducing vulnerabilities

• Controls can be classified based on their objective
– Preventive
• Aim to prevent or reduce the likelihood of an incident happening
– Example: Encryption of files to prevent eavesdropping
– Example: Training people to recognise phishing attacks

– Detective
• Monitoring to identify attempts or successfully exploited vulnerabilities
– Example: Use of Intrusion Detection System
– Example: Manual processes to review unusual transactions

– Corrective
• Aim to recover from harm to information assets or business goals
– Example: Restore information from backups to get a service running
again

Summary
• Security is about protecting assets from damage or harm
– Information is an essential asset, and it needs to be protected

• Traditional 3 information security goals are
– Confidentiality
Integrity
A
– Also consider authentication, authorisation and non-repudiation

• Many threats to information assets, & many
vulnerabilities in information systems (More on this in Week 2)
– Security incident when threats and vulnerabilities coincide
– Incident referred to as an attack if result of deliberate action
– Can be serious even if non-deliberate
• Can create a vulnerability and lead to subsequent attacks

• Implement controls to try to achieve security goals
– Lots more on controls across the semester
