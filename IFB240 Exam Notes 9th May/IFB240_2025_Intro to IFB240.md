IFB240 Canvas site – one module for each week of semester
• You engage in these activities on your own, wherever you
like, across the week before attending your tutorial
– The analysing, evaluating and higher order learning happens in
a group space, in the tutorial sessions
• You should attend one 90-minute tutorial session per week
• Tutorial Question sets available on IFB240 Canvas site
