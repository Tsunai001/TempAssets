What is cyber security?
• Definitions:
– ‘Measures to protect the confidentiality, integrity and
availability of systems and data.’
• Australian Cyber Security Centre Cyber Security Terminology | Cyber.gov.au

– ‘Prevention of damage to, protection of, and
restoration of computers, electronic communications
systems, electronic communications services, wire
communication, and electronic communication,
including information contained therein, to ensure its
availability, integrity, authentication, confidentiality,
and nonrepudiation.’
• (United States) National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) cybersecurity Glossary | CSRC (nist.gov)

What is information security?
• Definitions:
– ‘The

protection of information and information
systems from unauthorised access, use, disclosure,
disruption, modification or destruction in order to
provide confidentiality, integrity and availability.’
• Australian Cyber Security Centre
– Glossary | Cyber.gov.au
• (United States) National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)

What is the difference between cyber
security & information security?
• Information Security
– Focusses on the information assets: protecting them from
damage or harm, or mitigating risk of harm

• Cyber Security
– Focusses on protecting computer systems and networks, and
the information stored in them or transmitted electronically, from
damage or harm
– Cyberspace
• environment formed by electronic components and networks used to store,
transmit and process electronic data

•

Strongly related concepts, but not quite the same
– Many people use these terms interchangeably!

•
•

In IFB240 we will discuss both: common fundamental concepts

News

• QUT experienced a
security incident in
December 2022
• Was it a

incident?
– Information Security
incident?
• Was there harm done?

Fundamental Concepts
• Both cyber and information security are about
protecting assets from harm
– First, you need to know
•
•
•
•

What your assets are that need to be protected
Where they are located
What value they have, and how critical they are
What could possibly happen to cause harm to them
– Consider both accidental and intentional events

– Then can consider protection methods, and costs to
•
•
•
•

Prevent damage to asset (or at least minimize damage)
Detect damage to asset – when, how, who?
React to recover from damage – take corrective actions

Fundamental Concepts - Assets
• What are your assets, and where are they?
– Assets are things that have value
• Information assets
– Any collection of data, stored in any manner, having value
• Property
– Physical assets: buildings and contents
– Hardware, Software, Networking components

• People
– Colleagues & Employees,
– Contractors, Customers/Clients

• Procedures
– Used to collect, store, process, transmit, & display data

• Non-tangible assts - Reputation

Fundamental concepts – Assets
• What are your assets worth?
– For information assets, consider
• Cost to acquire, or

• Value they add (for you, or for your organisation)

• How critical are they?
– For each identified information asset, consider
• What the asset is used for
• Who uses it
• How critical is it

– How would objectives be impacted if the asset was not available?
• Example: Web server for online store or government department

Traditional information security goals
Assets can be harmed if these goals are breached
CONFIDENTIALITY
• Assurance that
information is not
disclosed to
unauthorised
individuals,
processes, or
devices (no
unauthorised
disclosure)

INTEGRITY
• Assurance that
data has been
created,
amended or
deleted only by
authorised
individuals (no
unauthorised
modification)

AVAILBILITY
• Assurance that
resources are
accessible and
usable when
required by an
authorised user

Queensland
– November 2015
– Reported in The Courier
Mail

Additional security goals
• Additional goals that are important for security
– Authentication
• Entity authentication – the process of verifying a claimed
identity
– Is this person actually who they say they are? How can I be sure?

• Data origin authentication – verify the source (and integrity) of
a received message
– Is this message from the place/sender it claims to be, (and
is this the message that was sent)?

– Non-repudiation
• Create evidence that an action has occurred, so that the user
cannot falsely deny the action later

Fundamental concepts and misconceptions
• Information security ≠ I.T. Security
– Information is stored, transmitted, processed and
displayed in many different ways – not just in IT systems
– Useful to understand fundamental concepts and apply
to information and/or systems

• Information security ≠ Confidentiality
– These are often confused, but confidentiality is not
the same as information security
• It’s just one aspect - confidentiality may be a goal for some
information, but is not always required
• Example: Information on a public website is not confidential,
but still needs protection
IFB240 Cyber Security

16

Security: It’s not always about confidentiality
Example: Feb 2, 2023 Black and White Cabs booking service offline after cyber attack - ABC News

Summary
• Security is about protecting assets from damage or harm
– Information is an essential asset and it needs to be protected
– Can focus on the information or on the systems used

• Fundamental concepts: Three traditional security goals
– Confidentiality
– Integrity
– Availability

• Other important aspects are
– Authentication
– Non-repudiation

• Important to understand these goals
– We will talk about these fundamentals throughout the semester
