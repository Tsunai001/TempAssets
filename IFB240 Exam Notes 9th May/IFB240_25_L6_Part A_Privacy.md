• Definition
- "A state in which one is not observed or disturbed
by other people, the state of being free from
public attention"
• Oxford dictionary
- "the interest that individuals have in sustaining 'personal space', free from interference by other people and organisations"
• Roger Clarke (member of the Australian Privacy Foundation)
• http://www.rogerclarke.com/DV/Intro.html


• Interpretation of privacy depends on context
- Roger Clarke's dimensions of privacy
• Privacy of the person
- Physical or bodily privacy: about the integrity of the body and consent to physical procedures
• Privacy of personal behaviour
- Including political, religious and sexual practices and preferences
• Privacy of personal communications
- Being able to communicate with other individuals without routine
monitoring by others
• Privacy of personal data
- Control over personal data and how it will be used, even when it is held by another organisation
• Privacy of personal experience
- Experience monitored and analysed: reading, viewing, interactions

• Some of these dimensions relate to information
• Personal communications
• Are your communications monitored by other people or
organisations? - Who, how, why, which details?
• Personal data
• Are your personal details available to others? - Who? How?
• Personal experience
• Are details of your personal experiences available to others? - Who, how, why?
• Q: Who should have access to your personal information?
- Ongoing debate about public interest v's individual rights
• Q: When can you be anonymous (not identified) in interactions?


• How much personal information about
• You
• Your communications
• Your personal experiences
  is collected, stored and used by others?
• Think about your activities today, and the data footprint you have
generated
- Where is that data held?
- How much control do you have over it?
- Can those with your personal information do whatever they want
with it?

Privacy and information security
• Recall (from L3) that cyber and info sec risk management process involves establishing the context, considering
