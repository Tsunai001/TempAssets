       Lecture 2 - Part A Threats to information & systems
Dr Leonie Simpson lr.simpson@qut.edu.au


• Information
- is an important asset for individuals and organisations, and
- is stored, transmitted, processed and displayed in various formats
• Information security
- is about protecting information assets from damage or harm
• Cyber security
- is about protecting the confidentiality, integrity and availability of
systems, devices and the information residing on them
• Fundamental concepts in cyber/info sec: traditional goals
- C	: preventing unauthorised disclosure of information
- I	: preventing unauthorised modification or destruction of
information
- A	: ensuring resources are accessible when required by an authorised entity


• Threat

Review of terminology

- Any circumstance or event with the potential to cause harm to an asset by compromising security goals
• Potential cause of an undesirable event that results in harm
• Vulnerability
- Characteristic of, or weakness in, a system that could
- if acted on by a threat - result in harm to asset
• Security Incident
- Occurs when threats and vulnerabilities coincide
- Attack: when vulnerabilities are deliberately exploited




• Consider threats and vulnerabilities for all components of information system, and interactions between components



Threats - Terminology
• Threat actor
- Person or entity whose actions impact or have the
potential to impact information security
• also known as a malicious actor

• Threat action
- What was done or intended to cause harm to the information asset
- Vocabulary for Event Recording and Incident Sharing
(VERIS) have seven action categories
Error, Environmental, Hacking, Malware, Misuse, Physical, Social

Threat actors

• Common types of threat actors & motivations
- External
• Cyber criminals - money
• Hacktivist - ideology - support for a cause
• Nation-state attackers - political
• Script kiddies - thrill seeking, bragging rights
- Internal
• Careless/negligent worker - no intention to cause harm - unaware of security impact
• Malicious insider - money, or desire to disrupt




• Threat sources

Threats

- External: from outside an organisation or system
• Examples include people who are not authorized to use your information systems
- May need access to assets in order to cause harm
" Physical and/or logical access

- Internal: lies within the organisation or system
• Examples include people who are authorized to use information systems, but might use them in unauthorized manner: employees, contractors, clients, visitors, ...
- May misuse systems or exceed their authorization
- May damage systems accidentally




• Threat type
- Natural event
• Examples: Earthquake, Fire, Flood, Storm, Tornado, Tidal Wave, Extreme Temperature, Vermin

- Human action
• Accidental (no intent to cause harm)
- Examples: Acts of negligence, errors, omissions
• Deliberate (intended to cause harm)
- Examples: Espionage, fraud, sabotage, theft




• Natural events
- Potential for threat to occur may depend on physical location of the information asset
• Historical data may be useful indicator
• Recent examples:
- Australia: January 2020 - Bushfires
- Turkiye and Syria: February 2023 - Earthquake
- Japan: July 2018 - Floods, landslides
- Hawaii: May 2018 - Volcano
- Brisbane: January 2022 floods
- Most likely results in compromise of ...
• Which goal? Think C I A




• Example: Australian bushfires Dec 2019 - Jan 2020

destroyed/11835740


• Example: Turkiye & Syria earthquake Feb 2023
• UN says at least 50,000 killed in Turkey and Syria quakes - ABC News (go.com)


• Example: Cyclone Gabrielle, NZ, February 2023
• Cyclone Gabrielle worst storm to hit New Zealand this century, says PM | Cyclone Gabrielle | The Guardian




























IFB240	12

• Example: Brisbane floods - February 2022
- How were information systems affected in CBD? Think CIA?



• Human action - accidental
- No intention to cause harm, but actions do have
potential for harm. Examples include
• Accidental damage to equipment
• Change management errors
• Configuration errors
• Lost property
• Misdirecting messages
• Operational errors (accidental deletion of files, incorrect data entry)
• Programming errors ...
- Consider physical and logical assets
- Security goals compromised?
• depends on both the accidental action and information asset


• Example: Human action - accidental
- https://www.arnnet.com.au/article/642158/telstra-flags-weekend-repair- work-after-cable-cut-kills-services/



• Example: Human action - accidental
- G20 Summit, Brisbane November 2014
- https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/30/personal-details-of-world-leaders-accidentally-revealed-by- g20-organisers
- https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1697616-g20-world-leaders-data-breach.html

• Example: Human action - accidental
- Prince William royal photo shoot, November 2012
- https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2012/11/21/prince-william-photos-password/



• Human action - deliberate
- Actions intended to cause harm to information assets
• Examples include:
- Eavesdropping, Espionage, Extortion, Fire, Fraud, Industrial action, Malicious code, Sabotage, Social engineering, Theft, Vandalism
- Consider physical and logical assets
- Possible to compromise all security goals
• Depends on the actions taken and the asset involved

• For the examples listed above, determine the security goal most likely to be compromised


• Example: Human action - deliberate

• Equifax data breach
- September 2017

Hackers exploited a website application vulnerability

Gained access to data
- Names
- Birth dates
- Address
- Social security number ...




• Example: Human action - deliberate
• Apple former employee and theft of trade secrets
• https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/pr/former-apple-employee-indicted-theft-trade-secrets



• Example: Human action - deliberate - Malware
- Malicious software deliberately designed to breach security of computer based information systems
- Depending on payload, malware can compromise
• Confidentiality: For example, logging keystrokes to obtain passwords
• Integrity: For example, by writing a message, or corrupting data files
• Availability: For example, by deleting data or application files

- Currently many cybercriminals using malware to take control of systems, and extort money from individuals or organisations to return access to systems and data - known as ransomware


• Human action - deliberate
- Common malware types
• Viruses - programs with ability to replicate
- Spreads by copying itself into other files (infecting) and is
activated when infected files are opened or exe's run
• Worms - programs with ability to self replicate
- Spreads from computer to computer without human interaction
• Trojan horses - programs with known desirable properties
and hidden undesirable property
- User downloads the program and knowingly uses desirable features
- Undesirable feature runs without user knowledge

 Emerging technologies result in changes in the threat landscape

Summary
• Many threats to information assets and systems
• To protect information assets, need to understand context:
- What is the information asset?
- Where is it located, and what state is the information in?
- Possible threats - how could this asset be harmed?
• Why protect this information asset?
- What is the value of the asset, and how critical is it?
- Potential consequences if the asset is harmed?
