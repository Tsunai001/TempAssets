Why care about info/cyber security?
• Consider these items of your personal information
–
–
–
–

Name, Date of birth, Address

• Consider these items of corporate information:
– Names and addresses of
• Employees

Clients/customers

Suppliers

– Financial details for
• Employees Clients/customers
– Documents related to
• Details of upcoming promotions

• Which of these would an organisation be comfortable for
others to access? What sort of access?
•

Why care about information security?
• Lots of news stories about cyber-crime, what
does that mean?
– Cyber crime refers to electronic crime where
• Information & comms technology is the target
– Examples: Stolen device, Intrusions (Hacking), Computer
viruses, Denial of Service, DDoS
OR

• Technologies used as tools to enable an offence
– Examples: Phishing, Identity theft, Spam
– Traditional crimes: theft, fraud, vandalism, etc but
performed by using electronic information and
communications technology
– Growth in Internet usage and interconnection of systems makes
this increasingly likely

– This is part of cyber security, but not all …

Example: cyber security problem
• Ransomware
– Malware that encrypts users computer files, attackers then
demand a payment to permit decryption

Why care about info/cyber security?
• Example: Remote control of vehicles
– 21 July 2015 – WIRED article
– http://www.wired.com/2015/07/hackers-remotely-kill-jeep-highway/

– Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek (US) demonstrated exploit of
vulnerabilities in vehicle systems
• Took control of a Jeep Cherokee wirelessly - from 10km away
• Accessed the car’s entertainment system from cellular network,
then moved into controls; could monitor position & remotely change:
– Speed - increase/decrease
– Braking – on/off
– Wipers – on/off
– Climate – aircon/heating
– Sound – volume, radio station, etc
• Estimate approx 471,000 vulnerable vehicles

How can we improve security?
• Once you have some idea of
– What your info assets are, and where they are located
– What the assets are worth, and how critical they are
– What could possibly happen to cause harm to them
• Considering both accidental and intentional events

• You can consider how to protect information assets
from damage or harm, with possibilities including
–
–
–
–

Preventing damage to asset (or at least minimizing damage)
Detecting damage to asset – when, how, who?
Reacting to recover from damage – corrective actions

How can we improve security?
• Control measures can be categorised by type:
– Technology
• Examples: Lockable filing cabinet, Ciphers (encryption), Digital
signatures, Firewalls, IDS, tamper-resistant systems

– Policy and practice
• Examples: Acceptable use policies, data protection policies,
asset disposal policies, HR practices, plan outlining organisation
approach to managing information security, …

– Education, training and awareness
• Examples: employee training against social engineering, in
password selection and protection, in data classification and
media handling, …

• Technology alone is not enough
– remember people are components of information systems

Useful diagram to combine security ideas
Model described by the U.S. Department of Defense, published by the National
Security Telecommunications and Information Systems Security (20 June
1994) as NSTISSI 4011 Security Model, now known as the McCumber cube

NSTISSI 4011 provides a framework
for discussing Information Security

Summary
• Security is about protecting assets from damage or harm
– Information is an essential asset and it needs to be protected

• Consider how harm could occur (breach of C, I or A?)
– Many threats to information assets & many vulnerabilities in
information systems
• Need to understand what info you need, where it is, how it is stored,
transmitted, and used

– Harm could be result of deliberate or accidental actions

• Implement controls to try to achieve security goals
– Preventive controls only insufficient – also need detective &
corrective controls
