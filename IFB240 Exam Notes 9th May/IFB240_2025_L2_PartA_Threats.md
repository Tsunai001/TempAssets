Introduction
• Information
– is an important asset for individuals and organisations, and
– is stored, transmitted, processed and displayed in various formats

• Information security
– is about protecting information assets from damage or harm

• Cyber security
– is about protecting the confidentiality, integrity and availability of
digital systems, devices and the information residing on them

• Fundamental concepts in cyber/info sec: traditional goals
– Confidentiality: preventing unauthorised disclosure of information
– Integrity: preventing unauthorised modification or destruction of
information

– Availability: ensuring resources are accessible when required by
an authorised entity

Introduction
Review of terminology
• Threat
– Any circumstance or event with the potential to cause
harm to an asset by compromising security goals
• Potential cause of an undesirable event that results in harm

• Vulnerability
– Characteristic of, or weakness in, a system that could
- if acted on by a threat - result in harm to asset

• Security Incident
– Occurs when threats and vulnerabilities coincide
– Attack: when vulnerabilities are deliberately exploited

Threats - Terminology
• Threat actor
– Person or entity whose actions impact or have the
potential to impact information security
• May be referred to as a malicious actor

• Threat action
– What was done or intended to cause harm to the
information asset
– Vocabulary for Event Recording and Incident Sharing
(VERIS) have seven action categories
Error, Environmental, Hacking, Malware, Misuse, Physical, Social

Threat actors
• Common types of threat actors & motivations
– External
•
•
•
•

Cyber criminals - money
Hacktivist – ideology – support for a cause
Nation-state attackers - political
Script kiddies – thrill seeking, bragging rights

– Internal
• Careless/negligent worker – no intention to cause harm –
unaware of security impact
• Malicious insider – money, or desire to disrupt

Threats
• Threat sources

Data

Procedures

Hardware

Software

– External: from outside an organisation or system
• Examples include people who are not authorized to use
your information systems
– May need access to assets in order to cause harm
» Physical and/or logical access

– Internal: lies within the organisation or system
• Examples include people who are authorized to use
information systems, but might use them in unauthorized
manner: employees, contractors, clients, visitors, …
– May misuse systems or exceed their authorization
– May damage systems accidentally

Threats
• Threat type
– Natural event
• Examples: Earthquake, Fire, Flood, Storm, Tornado, Tidal
Wave, Extreme Temperature, Vermin

– Human action
• Accidental (no intent to cause harm)
– Examples: Acts of negligence, errors, omissions
• Deliberate (intended to cause harm)
– Examples: Espionage, fraud, sabotage, theft

Threats
• Natural events
– Potential for threat to occur may depend on physical
location of the information asset
• Historical data may be useful indicator
• Recent examples:
– Australia: February 2024 massive storms in Victoria
– Turkiye and Syria: February 2023 – Earthquake
– New Zealand: February 2023 - Cyclone
– Australia: Brisbane: January 2022 floods
– Australia: January 2020 – Bushfires
– Japan: July 2018 – Floods, landslides
– Hawaii: May 2018 - Volcano

– Most likely results in compromise of …

Threats
• Human action – accidental
– No intention to cause harm, but actions do have
potential for harm. Examples include
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Accidental damage to equipment
Change management errors
Configuration errors
Lost property
Misdirecting messages
Operational errors (accidental deletion of files, incorrect data entry)
Programming errors …

– Consider physical and logical assets
– Security goals compromised?
• depends on both the accidental action and information asset

Threats
• Human action – deliberate
– Actions intended to cause harm to information assets
• Examples include:
– Eavesdropping, Espionage, Extortion, Fire, Fraud,
Industrial action, Malicious code, Sabotage, Social
engineering, Theft, Vandalism

– Consider physical and logical assets
– Possible to compromise all security goals
• Depends on the actions taken and the asset involved
• For the examples listed above, determine the security goal
most likely to be compromised

Threats
• Example: Human action – deliberate - Malware
– Malicious software deliberately designed to breach
security of digital information systems
– Depending on payload, malware can compromise
• Confidentiality: For example, logging keystrokes to obtain
passwords
• Integrity: For example, by writing a message, or corrupting
data files
• Availability: For example, by deleting data or application files
– Currently many cybercriminals using malware to take control of
systems, and extort money from individuals or organisations to
return access to systems and data – known as ransomware
2025

21

Threats
• Human action – deliberate
– Common malware types
• Viruses – programs with ability to replicate
– Spreads by copying itself into other files (infecting) and is
activated when infected files are opened or exe’s run
• Worms – programs with ability to self-replicate
– Spreads from computer to computer without human
interaction
• Trojan horses – programs with known desirable properties
and hidden undesirable property
– User downloads the program and knowingly uses
desirable features
– Undesirable feature runs without user knowledge

Emerging technologies result in changes in
the threat landscape
- means threat assessment must be ongoing

• Consider changes in document storage over time:
– How are documents stored?
– Where are the documents stored?
– Who can access the documents? What type of access?
• Local/Remote?
• Physical/electronic?
2025

– What can they do with/to the documents with potential for harm?
23

Summary
• Many threats to information assets and systems
• To protect information assets, need to understand
context:
– What is the information asset?
– Where is it located, and what state is the information
in?
– Possible threats – how could this asset be harmed?

• Why protect this information asset?
– What is the value of the asset, and how critical is it?
– Potential consequences if the asset is harmed?
