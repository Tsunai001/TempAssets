The above article is not valid as it does not relate to the Yoga 7i Laptop

- No citation of the Privacy Policy. (Privacy Impact Analysis>Policy Analysis)
- [[1]"Not true, For the customer to be using the massager service they have consented to this data being collected as part of themselves establishing an account on the Meta platform."]: "This would create a regulatory vulnerability as customers have not provided consent for their
preferences and personal information to be shared with Meta or its third-party partners. With 16,800
customer profiles managed by the restaurant, as noted in the Data Profile section, this represents a
substantial compliance risk under Australian Privacy Legislation (Privacy Act 1988 (Cth))." [[2]"This point is very valid, there is a risk of data bleed, or contamination between the personal and business communications.
This raises a point that the account(s) being used in the Metasphere is there One for the machine, and owner, or several? If more than one how are they being managed?"]:"The lack
of data segregation between personal and business communications further exacerbates this risk,
potentially leading to regulatory penalties and reputational damage if customer data is subjected to
malpractice".

- ["Only one risk is detailed, that being the privacy risk.

There is no explanation of the methodologies of how this risk was assessed, or how the other risks could be assessed.

As there is only One risk there is no priority either."] (Risk Evaluation and Prioritisation for Treatment Section).

- ["Not acceptable appendices. Full copies of the document are expected here."]: (Appendices: *It included the 3 articles in pdf form, im unsure what its asking*).
