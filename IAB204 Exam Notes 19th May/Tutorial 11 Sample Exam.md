QUESTION 26
A user can request a quiz for the system. The system picks a set of questions from its database, and compose them together to make a quiz. It rates the user's answers, and gives hints if the user requests it. In addition to users, we also have tutors who provide questions and hints. And also examinators who must certify questions to make sure they are not too trivial, and that they are sensical. Make a use case diagram to model this system. Work out some of your use cases.

QUESTION 40:
RockOn's management has hired you as their Business Analyst and assigned you to develop a detailed cost benefit analysis. Based on your analysis, the following options can be considered for the new system.
Option 1. Develop the system using opensource technologies. This will require you to hire three (3) senior and four (4) junior software developers for six (6) months. The senior software developers are estimated to work 2500 hours and junior software developers are estimated to work 3000 hours to complete the system. The market rate for a senior software developer is $200/hour whereas a junior software developer will cost $90/hour. You planned to purchase 8 touchscreens for four entrances. Each touchscreen will cost $8,000. The system will require a new cabling network. You estimated that the whole network will require 5000 meters of fibre optic cable at a cost of $80/meter. In addition to the cabling cost, you will also need the 8 network switches at the cost of $4,500/each. The cabling installation will be outsourced to an external company for a fixed cost of $8000. The maintenance of the new system will be outsourced to Intellicube Systems for a fixed annual cost of $300,000/year starting from the first year of implementation. Additionally, the cost of internet services is estimated at $2500/month and electricity will cost an additional $3000/month. 
 Option 2. Buy a Commercial Off the Shelf Software (COTS). This option will require a reliable ready-to-use system. After reviewing a few options, you believe that the TicTok Ticket System (3TC) will be a good solution. However, 3TC will require some customisations to satisfy RockOn's needs. After a lengthy discussion, you managed to get them to make the customisations for a fixed cost of $1,500,000. Furthermore, 3TC will require a monthly subscription cost of $50,000. The cost of new network and equipment will be same as Option 1. 3TC system will require a high-speed internet service that will cost $5,000/month and $4,000 as electricity expanse.     
Cashflows provided in the following table are estimated from estimated increase in sales. The expected life of each of the options is 5 years. The project's after-tax cash flows follow a typical life cycle pattern. They rise as sales build, then flatten and decline as competing applications enter the market, or as demand for the game wanes. You estimated a 70%, 20%, and 10% distribution of ticket sales between different ticketing options offered by the new system. At present, a 12% rate of returns is required by the shareholders for 5-year projects.
Estimated Sales Year 1Year 2Year 3Year 4Year 5Estimated Sales (Tickets)1800019800225002587524500Normal Ticket Price (70%)$60$65$68$75$80QR Discounted Ticket Price (20%)$50$50$55$55$60Online Streaming Ticket Price (10%)$30$30$35$40$45Using the details provided in the above scenario, prepare a financial feasibility analysis using the following assessment measures. 
(a) Project Payback Period (PBP).               			(2 marks)
(b) Return on Investment (ROI)					(3 marks)
(c) Project Net Present Value (NPV).          			(5 marks)
(d) Project Internal Rate of Return (IRR).    			(5 marks)
