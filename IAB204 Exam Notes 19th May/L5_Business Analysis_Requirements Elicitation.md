Elicitation
• A process of extracting the information from
users, customers, and group of people.
• Business Analysts elicit:
• An understanding of the organisational
environment by:
• information about the causes of a
business problem, OR
• reason for addressing a business
opportunity
• Business, stakeholder, solution, and
transition requirements
• information needed to develop
requirements for solution and
implementation

Elicitation Vs Requirement
Gathering

Requirement Gathering Assumes “details
are readily available” in an “Explicit Form”
Stakeholder;
– Have “Needs & Wants”
– Don’t have the ability to express their
requirements clearly (Tacit Knowledge
Problem)
– They know the existence of a problem,
but not know exactly what the problem is.
– They see potential/opportunity but may
not know how to address it.

Elicitation Fundamentals
• Problem definition and solution
scoping are highly interdependent
and iterative
• Need to understand 2 major issues:
• How to capture and represent
multiple perspectives on “the
problem”?
• How to separate cause (the real
problem) from effect (symptoms
stakeholders tend to report)

Understanding Business Analysis
Governance

Step1:
Elicitation
Planning

• Overview:
• Importance of governance in business analysis
• Collaboration with governance roles
• Value:
• Mitigating risks related to noncompliance
• Efficient use of shared processes and practices
• How to Understand:
• Investigative work to identify mandatory policies and procedures
• Creating responsibility assignment matrices

Business Analysis Governance
• Is primarily investigative work that is required to understand mandatory policies,
procedures, rules, and governance structures relevant to business analysis.
• Business analysis practitioners must connect with stakeholders both within and
outside the organization to gather necessary information.
• Artifacts used may include policy documents, organizational business rules,
catalogues, repositories, and records from previous projects.
• A responsibility assignment matrix can be created and shared to confirm
understanding of roles and responsibilities related to business-analysis-related
decisions.

Planning Business Analysis Work
• Understanding project approach (Adaptive vs
Predictive)
• Understanding organisational culture.
• Identifying value-adding activities and potential
stakeholders/partners
• Scaling and tailoring business analysis work
• Value:
• Setting expectations with stakeholders
• Creating a shared understanding of the plan
• How to Plan:
• Collaborating with project managers and other
stakeholders
• Creating business analysis plans and deliverables

•Scope Definition:
•Outlines the specific activities to be undertaken
during the business analysis.
•Defines the deliverables that will be produced by the
business analysis team.
•Resource Allocation:
•Identifies the roles and responsibilities of individuals
involved in the business analysis process.
•Process Approach:
•Establishes clear procedures for:
•Prioritizing requirements.
•Documenting requirements.
•Validating requirements.
•Communicating requirements.
•Approving requirements.
•Managing changes to requirements.

Planning Business Analysis Work
•Clear Understanding of Planning Decisions:
•Business analysis practitioners ensure all stakeholders understand the plan.
•This helps stakeholders know what to expect during business analysis activities.
•Resolving Disagreements:
•The practitioner facilitates negotiations to reach consensus among team members.
•They may also participate as a team member to achieve agreement.
•Documenting Decisions:
•Documenting decisions helps prevent future conflicts during the analysis work.
•Adaptive Environments:
•High-performing teams in agile environments may have shared understandings of activities and decisions.
•Planning decisions may be captured in teaming agreements or not documented at all.

Planning Business Analysis Work
Decisions made as a part of business analysis planning (influenced by the approach used, either predictive,
adaptive, or hybrid)
• Type of elicitation activities to be conducted;
• Requirements analysis models to be used;
• How requirements will be documented and communicated to stakeholders, including the use of any
specialized tools;
• Business analysis deliverables to be produced;
• Roles and responsibilities for those participating in the requirements-related activities;
• How requirements will be prioritized, approved, and maintained;
• List of requirements that will be tracked and managed in the requirements documentation, such as
business requirements document (BRD) or requirements traceability matrix (RTM);
• How requirements will be validated and verified;
• How the acceptance criteria will be determined for the requirements and solution validation;
• What aspect of the solution will be evaluated; and
• How, when, and who will evaluate the solution.

Step 2: Prepare for Elicitation
•

Develop a roadmap to ensure that;
• all needed resources are identified
and organised.
• a detailed schedule is ready for a
particular elicitation activity.
• define the specific activities and the
planned sessions.
• Resource contact
• Availability (Date/Day/time)
• Mode/medium
• Duration
• Venue
• Etc.

•

For each session:
– Plan the objective
• Should provide value to justify
resources
• The motivation to participate
– Identify who should attend
• Invite resources,
• Schedule appropriate time
– Prepare questions
• Should be aimed at the objective

Step 3: Elicitation Techniques
•
•
•

•

Use a combination of complementary
elicitation techniques.
For example
• Interviews + Document Analysis
Multiple factors guide which techniques will
be used
• the business domain
• the corporate culture and environment,
• the skills of the analyst and
• the requirements deliverables that
need to be created
Techniques determine deliverables!

Step 4: Document Elicitation Results
• Types of input documentation depends on the
information gathering technique:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Notes from workshops in predetermined format
Audio visual resources
Whiteboard printouts
List of items deferred to ‘Parking Lot’
Existing Documentation
Problem Record

• Combine all inputs into acceptable format as
input for the Confirm phase.

27

Step 5: Confirm Findings
• Organise and document the elicited
information
• Send documents to the stakeholder(s)
for review
• May point out missing or incorrect,
or have additional information
• The review is not about the validity
of the requirements but rather
whether the information has been
collected and documented
adequately

• Issues raised should be kept in
a separate list
• Constraints, risks,
assumptions
• Enables BA to stay focussed by
not immediately following the

Elicitation Challenges
1. Inability to Get Access to the Right Stakeholders:
•

Challenge: Difficulty in directly interacting with actual users,
leading to potential misalignment in user interfaces or
processes.

•

Solution: Focus on available information from multiple
sources (e.g., documentation, training materials). Inform the
sponsor and project team if stakeholders are inaccessible. In
adaptive environments, include a customer representative for
easy access.

3. Not Getting the Requirements Needed:
•

Challenge: Stakeholders may struggle to understand the business
problem or approach elicitation with a solution in mind.

•

Solution: Help stakeholders understand the problem domain and focus
on high-level requirements. Break down requirements and ask clarifying
questions to draw out necessary details.

4. Stakeholders Do Not Know What They Want:
•

Challenge: Stakeholders may understand the problem but cannot
visualize the solution.

•

Solution: Use prototyping or storyboards to help stakeholders visualize
possible solutions. Work iteratively to get feedback before developing
the entire solution.

2. Conflicting Viewpoints and Needs among Different Stakeholders:
•

Challenge: Stakeholders from different parts of the
organization may have differing needs and solutions.

•

Solution: Build rapport and empathy to understand various
perspectives. Focus on the business problem and benefits.
Maintain neutrality and provide clarity on decision-making
processes. In adaptive environments, a customer
representative can help reconcile differences.

5. Stakeholders Not Providing Sufficient Detail to Develop the Solution:
•

Challenge: Stakeholders may lack experience in providing requirements
or understanding the level of detail needed.

•

Solution: Use visual modelling techniques to engage stakeholders and
open dialogue. Collaborate on workflows or hierarchical models to
uncover necessary details.
