business analysts

```
A set of practices and techniques that can apply and
add value to every industry
```
Only applicable to IT and the software industry

A set of common practices that can be done by many

people collaboratively and iteratively

A mysterious set of practices done in isolation that

only a few technical people will know how to use

Tailored to the organisation and the stakeholders’

needs

A one-size-fits-all approach that can be applied

### Case Study – Qld State Rail

The Chief Operations Officer (COO) for QLD State Rail has called the BA’s team to a meeting.

In the meeting the COO states that there is a problem that needs a solution.

- Rail services are being cancelled due to a lack of drivers
- The lack of drivers is contributing to delays in services
- Delays in services is resulting in customer discontentment
- There has been a steady increase in customer complaints.

QLD rail prides itself on reliability and on time running of its services and is concerned that its

reputation is being tarnished.

- As BA’s it is important to use various tools understand the environment both internal and external. Why?


```
Business Analysis Tutorials
10
```
### Case Study - continues

- Historically, drivers have regularly accepted 30

hours per week of overtime work (on average),

which is high but still within acceptable ranges

- Government approval (and funding) has been

allocated for work which will increase capacity to

increase service offering

- State Rail is the only provider of public rail

services in the State

- Patronage is declining – people are using the

trains less

The BAs discuss the issue with the COO and other key stakeholders and discover the following points:

- 20-30% of regular services are being cancelled

daily

- Timetables are published and need regular

updates. Difficult when there are constant

cancellations

- Timetables are calculated 6 months prior, based

on the total average hours worked by drivers

- Driver hours are estimated based on historical

data which is collected and reviewed regularly

and is used as input when publishing timetables

- Customers are venting their frustrations on

social media


```

```
**Trends and Patterns;**

 Drivers are declining overtime offered

 There has been a recent rise in the number

of drivers taking sick and/or stress leave.

 It is becoming increasingly difficult to recruit

drivers resulting in an acute shortage of

driver and driver trainers (staff with sufficient

experience to teach new candidates how to

drive trains)

 There has been a recent rise in the number

of drivers quitting their jobs

 Mining and other transport related industries

are experiencing a boom and are offering

higher salary packages

**Corporate policy;**

 Drivers - must have minimum 3 years as a

guard before they can apply to become a

driver

 Drivers - must have 12-hour break

between shifts

 Drivers – must not work more than 10

consecutive hours

 Training - New drivers takes on average

9-12 months

 Training - New driver training must be

done in-house

```

**Business Analysis Tutorials**

- **Create the Grid** : Draw a 3x3 grid on your slide. Label the x-axis as
    "Influence" (Low to High) and the y-axis as "Power" (Low to High)

Template Provided

- **Identify Stakeholders** : List all the stakeholders you want to plot on
    the matrix

Use the stakeholders from previous activity

- **Assess Power/ Influence vs Interest** : For each stakeholder, assess
    their level of power and influence. Power refers to their ability to
    influence the project, while influence refers to their interest or
    involvement in the project.
- **Plot Stakeholders** : Place each stakeholder in the appropriate cell
    of the grid based on their assessed power and influence levels.
- **Analyse and Act** : Use the matrix to identify which stakeholders need
    more attention and how to manage them effectively.

- Root Cause Analysis (RCA) identifies

underlying issues causing problems.

- The 5 Whys technique involves asking 'why'

multiple times to dig deeper.

- It's a simple yet powerful tool for problem-

solving and decision-making.

- RCA helps prevent recurrence of issues by

addressing root causes.

- Effective use of 5 Whys encourages team

collaboration and insights.

### Understanding Root Cause Analysis and

### the 5 Whys

```

```

**Business Analysis Tutorials**

- **Identify the Problem** : Clearly define the problem you want to analyse. Write it at the head of the fishbone

diagram.

- **Draw the Fishbone Structure** : Draw a horizontal line with the problem statement at the head. Draw

several branches off the main line to represent different categories of potential causes.

- **Categorise Causes** : Label each branch with categories such as People, Processes, Environment,

Management, and External Factor (you choose)

To identify potential causes of the problem under each category, apply the 5 why technique:

- **Ask Why** : Within each category, ask why the problem is occurring and write down the answer.
- **Ask Why Again** : For each answer, ask why it is happening and write down the answer.
- **Repeat** : Continue asking why until you reach the root cause of the problem, typically after five iterations.
- **Analyse the Diagram** : Review the diagram to identify the most likely root causes of the problem.
- **Address the Root Cause** : Once the root cause is identified, develop a plan to address it and prevent the

problem from recurring.

### Case Study – Too many Venues

```
In 2024, an inner-suburban hotel in Australia, part of a national chain licensed for alcohol sales and late-night
entertainment, faces a significant downturn in business. This decline is attributed to competition from similar
establishments located just 2-3 kilometres away in the city. The hotel, once renowned as a live music venue
for emerging local artists, has seen its primarily under-25-year-old clientele drift away.
```
```
The hotel's downturn is partly due to challenges in sourcing quality artists through informal networks. These
artists, who are paid a nominal appearance fee, often leave for better-paid gigs at other venues once they start
gaining popularity. The hotel does not charge a cover fee for events, and public transport is easily accessible.
Despite the decline, the hotel prides itself on providing a safe environment for its patrons
```
**Key Personnel**

- **John Black** , Hotel Manager: Aims to maintain the business model of offering opportunities for emerging

```
artists and an affordable, safe venue for patrons. Recognises the need to source artists from a broader base
and promote them cost-effectively.
```
```
John proposes developing an online nomination/audition facility. This platform would allow artists to register
and upload performance clips, which could be used to schedule, advertise, and build promotional activities
around events.
```

```

```
### Case Study - continues

**Constraints and Considerations**

- Maintain the core business model of supporting
    emerging artists.
- Develop a cost-effective method to source and
    promote artists.
- Ensure the platform adheres to enterprise
    architecture standards and data security
    requirements.

```
This case study highlights the challenges faced by a
suburban hotel in Australia and the proposed
initiative to develop an online platform to source and
promote artists.
```
```
The National Head Office supports the hotel in seeking solutions to the downturn. They are willing to sponsor
the development of the online platform, to expand it to other venues in the chain. However, the platform must
conform to the current enterprise architecture standards and meet all data security requirements

```
- **Identify the Central Problem or Idea** : Write the main problem or idea in the center of a grid.
- **Generate Related Ideas** : Surround the central problem with eight related ideas or solutions.
    These ideas should be written in the surrounding boxes.
- **Expand Each Idea** : For each of the eight surrounding ideas, create a new grid. Place the idea in
    the center and generate eight new related ideas around it.
- **Repeat the Process** : Continue expanding each new idea until you have explored all possible
    solutions or ideas.
- **Evaluate and Prioritise** : Review all the generated ideas and prioritize them based on feasibility,
    impact, and alignment with your goals.

```
This technique helps in breaking down complex problems into manageable parts and encourages
creative thinking by exploring multiple layers of ideas

A small café is considering replacing one of its waitstaff with a ‘robot’, a device that will take
orders, deliver food and interact with customers in an entertaining way.
```
```
The cost of the robot is $225,000. From the salary savings and the extra customers, the robot is
expected to attract, it is estimated that the net inflows from the idea will be:
```
- Year 1: $95,
- Year 2: $80,
- Year 3: $60,
- Year 4: $55,

```
Novelty is expected to lessen over time, and after four years the robot will be worthless and
superseded with a newer model.
```
- **Using the formulas discussed in lecture 4 perform a cost-benefit analysis and**
    **consider the following.**
       - Payback period calculations (PBP break-even)
       - Return on Investment (ROI)
       - Net Present Value (NVP)
       - Internal Rate of Return (IRR **)**

## Case Study – Too many Venues

```
In 2024, an inner-suburban hotel in Australia, part of a national chain licensed for alcohol sales and late-night entertainment,
faces a significant downturn in business. This decline is attributed to competition from similar establishments located just 2 - 3
kilometres away in the city. The hotel, once renowned as a live music venue for emerging local artists, has seen its primarily
under- 25 - year-old clientele drift away.
```
```
The hotel's downturn is largely due to challenges in sourcing quality artists through informal networks. These artists, who are
paid a nominal appearance fee, often leave for better-paid gigs at other venues once they start gaining popularity. The hotel
does not charge a cover fee for events, and public transport is easily accessible. Despite the decline, the hotel prides itself on
providing a safe environment for its patrons.
```
```
John Black, Hotel Manager aims to maintain the business model of offering opportunities for emerging artists and an
affordable, safe venue for patrons. Recognises the need to source artists from a broader base and promote them cost-
effectively.
```
```
John proposes developing an online nomination/audition facility. This platform would allow artists to register and upload
performance clips, which could be used to schedule, advertise, and build promotional activities around events.
```
```
The National Head Office supports the hotel in seeking solutions to the downturn. They are willing to sponsor the development
of the online platform, to expand it to other venues in the chain. However, the platform must conform to the current enterprise
architecture standards and meet all data security requirements.

Outback Outdoor Gear is a growing Australian e-commerce business specialising in outdoor equipment, including hiking gear, camping supplies,
and adventure tools. The company started as a small, family-owned store in Melbourne but has since transitioned into an online retailer to meet
the demands of modern consumers. With a strong reputation for quality products and excellent customer service, the business has built a loyal
customer base. However, as online sales increase, Outback Outdoor Gear is encountering operational and strategic challenges that need to be
addressed.
```
```
The growth of Outback Outdoor Gear’s online presence has brought with it a range of issues that need to be addressed to ensure the successful
continuation of the business. The company’s manual processes for tracking inventory cannot keep pace with the high volume of online orders.
Customers occasionally face “out of stock” notifications or receive delayed deliveries, leading to frustration. Online sales data is fragmented
across different current website which struggles to handle high traffic during seasonal sales events, leading to slow load times and occasional
crashes, which impact customer experience and sales. With many competitors in the online outdoor gear market, Outback Outdoor Gear
struggles to retain customer interest and maintain engagement through personalised marketing efforts.
```
```
The management team recognises the importance of establishing a seamless, scalable online presence to sustain their competitive advantage.
They have asked their internal business analysis team to evaluate the situation, propose solutions, and outline a strategy to implement
improvements. The proposed solution must align with the company’s long-term vision of becoming a leading name in outdoor gear. Management
has requested that the solution must integrate seamlessly with existing systems, including the company’s website and payment gateways and
that it should include measures to enhance website performance during peak traffic periods. Given the importance of customer experience and
competition, Outback would also like the ability to personalise its customer engagement and requested that the team should consider features
such as targeted promotions, loyalty programs, and behaviour-based recommendations.
```
```
Given the current trends with data breaches, the new solution must consider data privacy and security as paramount, given the sensitive nature
of customer and sales data.

## Understanding Use Cases

```
A use case is a collection of related success and
failure scenarios, describing actors using the
system to support a goal
```

**Business Analysis Tutorials**

## Use Case basics

```
An Actor is any perso n, system or event external to the
system (under desi gn) that interact s with the system
```
```
An Association is a relationship between an actor
and a use case
```
```
A Stereotype is a relationship between use cases
```
<< >>

```
An Extend Stereotype will reference
an original (complete) use case, to
describe additional behaviour
```
```
An Include Stereotype makes use
of common or shared functionality
in another use case.

```
A Generalization is
a relationship that
indicates that one
use case is a
specialised version
of another use case
```
```
The System Boundary
defines the scope of the
system being modelled. It
separates the system from its
external environment,
indicating what is included
within the system and what is
outside of it.
```

**Business Analysis Tutorials**

- **Use case diagrams** provide a visual
    representation of interactions.
- **Use case descriptions** detail the flow of
    actions for each scenario.
- **Use case diagrams** focus on actors and their
    relationships with use cases.
- **Use case descriptions** outline preconditions,
    postconditions, and main scenarios.
- **Use case diagrams** are used for a high-level
    overview, while descriptions are in-depth.

lifecycle.

- It helps in verifying alignment with business

goals and objectives.

- Helps to meet customer expectations assuring

necessary approvals are obtained and

decisions registered.

- Ensures that each requirement adds business

value.

- Key activities include creating traceability

matrices and linking requirements to their

sources.

- Benefits include improved clarity, improved risk

management, scope management and easier

impact analysis.

## Understanding Requirements

## Traceability


**Business Analysis Tutorials**

- **Independent:** Requirements should stand alone without

dependencies.

- **Negotiable:** Allow for collaborative discussion to refine

requirements.

- **Valuable:** Each requirement must provide clear value to

stakeholders.

- **Estimatable** : Requirements should be easy to estimate in

terms of effort.

- **Small:** Keep requirements manageable for quick

implementation.

- **Testable:** Ensure that each requirement can be validated

through testing.

## Ensuring Quality with INVEST

**INVEST** represents a set of **quality attributes** , which have

similarities to the quality criteria listed above.


**Business Analysis Tutorials**

- A requirements traceability matrix (RTM) links

requirements to their sources.

- RTM ensures all requirements are covered by

design, development, and testing.

- It helps track changes and manage project scope

effectively.

- RTM facilitates impact analysis for changes in

requirements.

- It enhances communication among stakeholders

by clarifying project needs.

The Prescription Interaction Project is a project being done by a large pharmacy chain, _ChemistCo_.

_ChemistCo_ has a vision of minimising negative interactions between different drugs prescribed to its

customers and wants to aggressively identify any potential drug interactions as early as possible.

The company has been leading the effort to standardise drug interaction reporting and is working with a

consortium to create a shared database where potential drug interactions can be identified while still

safeguarding the rights of individual customers.

The list of different types of requirements is provided in Table 1 (next slide).

## Understanding Requirement Dependency

## Analysis


**Business Analysis Tutorials**

## TASK 2: Dependency Analysis

##### Common relationships are:

##### Necessity – implementing one particular requirement first needs another

##### requirement to be implemented. This relationship can be uni- or bi-

##### directional.

##### Effort – if the implementation of one requirement makes it easier to

##### implement another

##### Subset – when the requirement is the decomposed outcome of

##### another requirement

##### Value – when one requirement affects the desirability of another (+ve or

##### –ve) or is strongly related to another in delivering business value


**Business Analysis Tutorials**

###### Use the following requirements to:

- Determine the relationships between

###### each requirement.

- Categorise dependencies into

###### Necessity, Effort, Subset, and Value.

- Prioritise requirements based on their

###### interdependencies.

Business Analysis Tutorials
```
```
Molfeld, a rural town in South Australia with a population of ~2,000, blends Ngarrindjeri First Nations (15%), long-term Anglo-Celtic farming
families (60%), and recent migrants (25%: South Asian agricultural workers, Filipino healthcare staff, and Middle Eastern refugees resettled
post-2015).
Known for its agricultural heritage and close-knit community, Molfeld’s local health clinic has long been the cornerstone of accessible healthcare
for the town’s population. However, the state government decided to close the Molfeld 40-year-old health clinic to consolidate resources into an
expanded regional medical centre located 2 hours away in the larger town of Silverton regional hub.
The clinic serves as a critical nexus for the town’s diverse groups, offering culturally specific programs and has several Aboriginal and Torres
Strait Islander Health Practitioners (AHPs) that arenationally registeredhealthcare professionalswhoprovide culturallysafe, clinicalcare to
Indigenouscommunities, acting as a bridgebetween traditionalhealing practices and Western medicine.
This decision was driven by goals to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and provide specialised services in a centralised location.
The Organisational Perspective
From the government’s viewpoint, the closure was a necessary step. The clinic served only about a dozen patients per day, while the Silverton
centre was designed to handle hundreds, offering advanced diagnostic tools and specialist care. The state projected annual savings of $1.
million and emphasised that telehealth services and transportation subsidies would ease the transition for rural patients.
Despite the financial and operational rationale, early assessments underestimated the social and emotional impact on Molfeld’s residents. The
government assumed that telehealth kiosks and shuttle services would adequately replace in-person care, but this overlooked the realities of
limited internet access, transportation challenges, and the deep community ties to the local clinic.
```
## Case Study: Closing Molfeld clinic


```
Business Analysis Tutorials
School of Information Systems 7
```
**The Community Perspectives**

Several key individuals embodied the community’s varied reactions to the change

```
Emma Carter
```
```
A single mother and the clinic’s part-
time receptionist, Emma was
devastated by the news. She relied on
the clinic to care for her young son
Noah’s asthma and feared the added
burden of travelling to Silverton. Her
initial shock was marked by anxiety
over her family’s health and financial
stability.
```
```
Tom Reynolds
```
```
A retired farmer and respected
community leader, Tom was furious.
His wife Margaret, who suffers from
dementia, depended on the clinic for
regular care. Tom’s anger manifested
in vocal protests and organising
petitions, feeling that the closure was
a betrayal of rural residents.
```
```
Dr. Priya Kapoor
```
```
The clinic’s only full-time general
practitioner, Priya had relocated from
South Australia to serve Molfield’s
population. Her family stays in
Adelaide and she travels every
weekend to meet her family. Faced
with the closure, she is in a dilemma;
resisting the move to Silverton,
determined to continue providing care
locally through alternative means.
```
```
Liam O’Connor
```
```
A young paramedic and lifelong
Molfeld resident, Liam accepted the
change pragmatically. He organised a
volunteer driver network to help
residents reach Silverton and worked
to maintain a sense of community
support.
```
```
Aunty Rose Maralinga (Ngarrindjeri
Elder)
```
```
Cultural advisor at the clinic; ensures
traditional healing practices
complement Western medicine. Aunty
Rose believes that closing this clinic
severs their connection to Country.
“Our healing is land, story, and
community—not just pills.”
```
```
Aisha Khan (Ngarrindjeri-Indian
Nursing Student)
A nursing student and Molfeld native,
Aisha embraced the opportunity to
innovate. She led efforts to develop
telehealth education programs to help
residents adapt to new technologies
and maintain access to care
Develops multilingual health apps
blending traditional remedies (e.g.,
lemon myrtle for colds) with Western
medicine.

**Business Analysis Tutorials**

- The analysis involves identifying these forces,
    evaluating their strength, and developing
    strategies to strengthen the driving forces and
    weaken the restraining forces.
- Aids decision-making by visualising the
    dynamics of change and making informed
    decisions.
- Helps develop strategies to strengthen
    support for change.

## The Value of Lewin's Force Field Analysis

```
The theory is based on the idea that any situation is the result of a balance between driving forces
(which push for change) and restraining forces (which resist change
```

**Business Analysis Tutorials**

## Task 1a: Conduct a Force Field Analysis

**1. Identify the Current State** : Understand the current situation and the
    desired state you want to achieve.
       Identifying all driving and restraining forces can be complex.
**2. Identify Driving Forces** : List the forces that are driving the change. These
    could be internal or external factors that support the change.
**3. Identify Restraining Forces** : List the forces that are resisting the change.
    These could be internal or external factors that oppose the change.
       Assessing force strength is often subjective and varies by
       perspective.
**4. Evaluate the Strength of Each Force** : Assess the strength of each driving
    and restraining force. This can be done using a scale (e.g., 1 to 10) to
    quantify the impact of each force.
**5. Visual Representation** : Use a force field diagram to visually represent the
    driving and restraining forces. This helps to communicate the dynamics of
    change and inform decision-making

Total Restraining Forces: 35 / 40


**Business Analysis Tutorials**

- Total Restraining Force Score35 / 40
- Driving forces: improved efficiency and specialised
    services.
- Restraining forces: emotional impact and access
    issues.
**Imbalance Analysis**
- **Key Imbalance:** Restraining forces (40) outweigh
    driving forces (35), risking service underutilisation
    and community backlash.
- **Critical Gaps:**
    - Cultural safety (10)vs.policy alignment
       (6):State priorities ignore Indigenous health
       frameworks.
    - Transportation (9) vs.telehealth potential
       (7):Tech solutions fail without infrastructure.

- If satellite internet fails, what low-tech alternatives (e.g., community health flyers)
    could fill gaps?

```
Sustainability & Scalability Questions
Long-Term Viability:
```
- How can volunteer driver networks secure ongoing funding (e.g., local business
    sponsorships)?
- What training programs would empower migrants as cultural brokers?
    **Force Prioritisation Questions**
- **Urgency vs. Impact** :
- Should cultural safety (score: 10) or transportation (score: 9) be addressed first,
    given funding constraints?
- Which restraining forces, if unaddressed, risk irreversible harm (e.g., patient
    deaths)?


**Business Analysis Tutorials**

## Task 1b: Strategies to return balance

**Strengthen Driving Forces**

**Scale Aisha’s App**

- Action:Secure grants to add Ngarrindjeri
    language support and trauma-informed design.
- Impact:Addresses cultural/linguistic gaps for
    Indigenous and migrant users

**Policy Reform**

- Action:Mandate AHPs and bilingual staff at
    Riverton Clinic via state funding.
- Impact:Aligns with cultural safety frameworks
    (AIHW standards)

**Cultural Brokerage Program**

- Action:Train 10 locals (including Aisha) as
    “Health Navigators” with stipends.
- Outcome:Navigators accompany patients to
    Silverton, ensuring care aligns with
    cultural/religious needs.

**Weaken Restraining Forces**

**Cultural Safety**

- Action: Repurpose Molfeld Clinic as a
    “Healing Hub” with AHPs 3 days/week and
    migrant health workshops.
- Impact: Retains land-based care and
    multilingual support

**Transportation**

- Action: Partner with ride-shares for
    subsidised fares; retrofit buses with prayer
    spaces/Wi-Fi.
- Impact: Reduces costs and respects
    religious needs
- Leverage Point:Tom’s farming network
    provides free depot space for shuttles


```
Business Analysis Tutorials
```
- **Offer tailored support** ; cultural safety is not one-size-fits-all; it must
    address specific community needs.
- **Engaging** existing networks can provide valuable insights and feedback.
- **Use Storytelling** ; combine data with personal stories to enhance
    advocacy for resources.
- **Prioritise communication** ; Clearly articulate thewhy, how, andimpactof
    change using multi-channel approaches (emails, town halls, apps).
    Maintaintransparencyto reduce uncertainty and build trust
- **Deliver role-specific training;** Usemicrolearningandhands-on
    workshops. Train frontline managers incoachingandemotional
    intelligenceto address resistance
- **Provide the right Tools;** Deploythe right toolsthat support both low-tech
    and high-tech alternatives. Usecollaboration platformsto streamline task
    management and feedback loops.
- **Embed cultural considerations;** Co-design solutions withIndigenous
    leadersandmigrant representativesto ensure inclusivity.
**Critical Success Factors:**
- **Flexibility:** Adapt strategies as resistance or new barriers emerge
- **Empathy:** Addressindividual fears
- **Governance:** Establishcross-functional committeesto oversee cultural
    safety and migrant inclusion

## Key Learnings in Managing People Change


**Business Analysis Tutorials**

### Implementation

### Migration and Transition


**Business Analysis Tutorials**

- **Data Focus** : Ensuring that the data analysis and
    migration processes are thorough and accurate to avoid
    any data loss or corruption during the transition
- **Training and Guidance** : Providing comprehensive
    training and guidance to the business staff to ensure
    they are comfortable and proficient with the new system
- **User Aids Development** : Developing user aids such as
    guides and checklists to assist users in navigating the
    new system and processes
- **Implementation Strategy Evaluation** : Carefully
    evaluating different implementation strategies to
    determine the most effective approach for the specific
    context and needs of the organisation

## Key Areas for Migration and Transition


**Business Analysis Tutorials**

- **Direct Changeover** : Known as ‘big bang’,
    Instant switch to the new system.
- **Parallel Running:** Both old and new
    systems operate simultaneously.
- **Pilot Running:** Testing the new system in a
    controlled environment.
- **Phased Implementation:** Gradual rollout of
    the new system in stages.

## Exploring the Four Types of Migration


**Business Analysis Tutorials**

#### Implementation Stage | Migration and Transition

```
Possible implementation strategies include:
 Direct changeover(sometimes known as ‘big bang’):
```
Old System New System

Old System

New System

Time period

 **Parallel running:**

- **Strength:** Both old and new systems operate simultaneously, allowing for comparison and validation
- **Weakness:** Resource-intensive, as it requires maintaining two systems at the same time.
    - **Strength** : Instant switch to the new system, minimising the time spent in transition
    - **Weakness** : High risk of failure if issues arise, as there is no fallback option


```
Business Analysis Tutorials
```
#### Implementation Stage | Migration and Transition

**Possible implementation strategies include:**

 **Pilot running:**

Pilot group /

Business Area /

Location

Old System

New System New System New System

```
Pilot group /

Strength: Testing the new system in a controlled environment, reducing risk by identifying issues early
Weakness: Limited scope may not reveal all potential problems, and scaling up can be challenging
```
```
New System Phase 1
New System Phase 2
```
New System Full

New System Phase 3

 **Phased implementation:**

**Strength:** Gradual rollout of the new system in stages, allowing for adjustments and learning from each phase
**Weakness:** Prolonged transition period, which can lead to confusion and inconsistency


**Business Analysis Tutorials**

- Assess organisational readiness for change and
    resource availability.
- Evaluate current processes for adaptability to new
    solutions.
- Consider people factors, including skills, training
    needs, and resistance.
- Examine technology infrastructure for compatibility
    with the new system.
- Analyse data requirements to ensure
    comprehensive migration and access.
Determine the most appropriate approach/s to
implement the change for the Molfeld Case study

## Task 2: Evaluating Implementation

## Approaches

**Recommended Approach:** Hybrid Model with Phased Pilot

```
Approach Rationale How
```
3. Full Transition Achieve cost savings and
    standardisation post-validation
       - Complete cloud migration after pilot KPIs are met (e.g.,
          <5% data errors, 80% staff competency)
       - Retain Healing Hub as a telehealth access point for
          vulnerable groups.
2. Parallel Running Maintain existing clinic services
during pilot to avoid care gaps
- Keep Molfeld’s legacy system operational for 2-3 months
while Silverton’s cloud EHR is tested
- Use data sync tools to ensure continuity across systems
1. Pilot First Test telehealth integration
    (Aisha’s app) and cultural safety
    protocols in a controlled
    environment before full rollout
       - Migrate 10-15% of patient records to Riverton’s cloud
          EHR system initially.
       - Run the Molfeld Healing Hub 3 days/week with hybrid
          care


**Business Analysis Tutorials**

## Task 2: Evaluating Implementation

## Approaches

**Other considerations:** Hybrid Model with Phased Pilot

```
Staff
```
```
Training
```
- Role-specific modules:
    - AHPs: Cloud EHR navigation + cultural safety auditing
    - Nurses: Multilingual telehealth troubleshooting
- Use microlearning via Aisha’s app for just-in -time support
**Change Champions**
- Recruit bilingual staff to mentor peers

```
Process
```
```
Data Migration:
```
- Use incremental ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tools to map legacy fields to Silverton’s EHR
- Prioritise high-risk patient data (e.g., diabetes, mental health) first.
**Interoperability:**
Ensure Aisha’s app integrates with Silverton’s EHR via FHIR APIs

```
Organisation
```
- Governance: Establish a cross-functional team (AHPs, IT, community reps) to oversee
    compliance with AIHW Cultural Safety Framework
- Policy Alignment: Update protocols to include cloud security standards (HIPAA-equivalent) and
    Ngarrindjeri data sovereignty principle


**Business Analysis Tutorials**

### Task 2: Evaluating Implementation Approaches

**Other considerations:** Hybrid Model with Phased Pilot

```
Benefits of
approach
```
- **Balances Speed & Safety:** Pilots minimise disruption while parallel running ensures care continuity.
- **Aligns with National Digital Health Strategy (2023-2028):** Focuses on interoperability and culturally safe tech.
- **Builds Trust:** Co-design with Ngarrindjeri/migrant groups addresses historical inequities.

```
Risk Mitigation
```
- **Data Security** : Partner with AWS/GCP for HIPAA-aligned encryption and access logs.
- **Downtime Protocol** : Preload critical patient data on encrypted USBs for rural clinics
- **Cultural Safety** : Embed AHPs in Silverton’s data governance team to audit AI bias

```
Communication
```
```
General
```
- Arrange a town hall where all groups are represented, discuss and listen to concerns etc.
**For Patients:**
- Ngarrindjeri: Community meetings with Aunty Rose to explain cloud security in cultural terms
- Migrants: Illustrated guides in multiple languages showing app usage
- Arrange for Molfeld residents to tour Silverton facilities
**For Staff:**
- Arrange counselling sessions to discuss concerns or potential hardship ma
- Weekly “lessons learned” forums via Teams, anonymising concerns
- Gamify EHR proficiency with leaderboards (e.g., “Top Telehealth Navigator”)

```
Approx Timeline
```
- **Month 1-2:** Pilot EHR migration + Healing Hub soft launch.
- **Month 3-4:** Train staff and refine app based on pilot feedback.
- **Month 5:** Full transition with 24/7 bilingual helpdesk support.

- A state diagram consists of states, transitions, events, and
    activities.
- State diagrams to illustrate the dynamic view of a system.
- They are especially important in modeling the behaviour of
    an interface, class, or collaboration.
- State diagrams emphasise the event-ordered behaviour of
    an object, which is especially useful in modeling reactive
    systems.
- Assist in identifying potential states and transitions that may
    be overlooked.
- Support testing by clarifying expected behaviour in different
    states.

## Benefits of State Transition Diagrams


**Business Analysis Tutorials** School of Information Systems

## State Transition diagram

- A **state machine** is a behavior that specifies the sequences of states an object goes through during its lifetime in
    response to events, together with its responses to those events.
- A **state** is a condition or situation during the life of an object during which it satisfies some condition, performs some
    activity, or waits for some event.
- An **event** is the specification of a significant occurrence that has a location in time and space. In the context of state
    machines, an event is an occurrence of a stimulus that can trigger a state transition.
- A **guard condition** is evaluated after the trigger event for the transition occurs. It is possible to have multiple
    transitions from the same source state and with the same event trigger, as long as the guard conditions don’t
    overlap. A guard condition is evaluated just once for the transition at the time the event occurs. The Boolean
    expression may reference the state of the object.
- A **transition** is a relationship between two states indicating that an object in the first state will perform certain actions
    and enter the second state when a specified event occurs and specified conditions are satisfied. Activity is an
    ongoing non-atomic execution within a state machine.
- An **action** is an executable atomic computation that results in a change in the state of the model or the return of a
    value.
