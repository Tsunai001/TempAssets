Brainstorming: Six Thinking Hats

For information known or needed. “The facts, just the facts.”
For positive thinking, optimism, value, benefits.
For Risks, Difficulties, Problems
For Feelings, hunches and intuition.
For Creativity; the possibilities, alternatives, and new ideas.
For Planning, Manage the thinking process.

The process:
1. Introduce the Concept: Explain the Six
Thinking Hats method to the group.
2. Choose a Topic: Select a specific problem
or decision to address.
3. Rotate Through the Hats: Discuss the
topic from each perspective, one hat at a
time.
4. Record and Summarize: Document the
key points and insights generated during
each "hat" phase.
5. Make Decisions and Take Action: Use the
insights gained from each hat to make
informed decisions and develop action
plans.
