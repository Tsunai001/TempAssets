What is Business Analysis?
• Business analysis is the application of
• knowledge, skills and techniques used to:

• identify an organisation’s issues and needs
• pain points,
• opportunities,
• work as a liaison among an organisation’s stakeholders to
elicit, document and manage their requirements.
• recommend solutions that enable an organisation to achieve its
goals.
• facilitate successful implementation of the product, service, or
end result of the program or project

• Consistent – not contradictory, uses similar terms and wording, level of detail
• Unambiguous – only one interpretation
• Correct – will lead to a valid solution
• Feasible – within technical architecture, budget, time, resources
• Modifiable – logically structured so that requirements can be re-arranged easily
(*not changed)
• Testable – must be able to prove that the requirement has been fulfilled

of potential solutions
• Assumptions
– Factors believed to be true, but unconfirmed
– May relate to current or future state
– BA identifies, documents and attempts to confirm their accuracy and risk
– Then identifies and manages risks around these assumptions

– To understand current capabilities
– To identify the new capabilities
required by the enterprise to meet
the business need

maintain proposed solutions
– BAs need to identify the gaps that prevent the
organisation from meeting business needs and
achieving desired outcomes

7 Steps to Writing Use Cases
1. Identify scope
2. Identify actors and their goals
3. Create Use Case briefs (aka user stories)
For each brief:
4. Describe main scenario
5. Describe alternate and/or failure scenarios
6. Describe alternate and failure scenario steps
7. Include additional information such as pre- and post-conditions and other
necessary business rules

Activity
• A user can request a quiz for the system. The system picks a set of
questions from its database, and compose them together to make a
quiz. It rates the user’s answers, and gives hints if the user
requests it. In addition to users, we also have tutors who provide
questions and hints. And also examiners who must certify
questions to make sure they are not too trivial, and that they are
sensical.
• Make a use case diagram to model this system. Work out some of
your use cases.

Steps to Develop Data flow Diagram
1. Make a list of business activities to determine
a) External Entities
b) Data flows
c) Processes
d) Data Stores
2. Create a Context Diagram showing all external entities and data flows to and
from the system. DO NOT show any detailed processes or data stores.
3. Draw Level 0 data flow diagram. Show processes and data stores at general
level
4. Check for errors, ensure assigned labels are meaningful
5. Develop physical data flow diagram
6. Partition the physical data flow diagram by separating and grouping to facilitate
programming and implementation

Example

• Rick Williams, a Business Analyst, and Carla Moore, a Programmer/analyst, continued their work on the SWL PAYROLL SYSTEM
project. After completing detailed interviews and other fact-finding activities, Rick and Carla now understand how the current system
operates and the new requirements desired by users. They are ready to organize and document their findings by preparing a logical
model of the payroll system.
• After they completed the preliminary investigation, Rick and Carla felt that they knew more about the system entities and how they
interacted.
• The two analysts knew that the Payroll Department issues PAYCHECKS based on timesheet data submitted by Department Heads,
and that each Employee receives a W-2 FORM at the end of the year. They also knew that the Human Resources Department
prepares EMPLOYEE STATUS CHANGES, and the payroll department enters the PAY DATA. The diagram also noted the output of
State and Federal Government REPORTS and INTERNAL REPORTS to SWL’s Finance and payroll departments. The Credit Union
and the SWL Stock Transfer Department REPORTS and FUND TRANSFERs also were included.
• Using this information, Rick and Carla prepared a sketch of a context diagram and scheduled a meeting for the next day with Amy
Calico, director of the payroll department, to discuss the diagram. At the meeting, Amy made several comments:
• The human resources department would be setting up additional ESIP DEDUCTION CHOICES for employees under a new 401(k) plan.
Human resources also would receive ESIP REPORTS from the payroll system.
• The payroll department enters timesheet data received from department heads, who do not interact directly with the system. Rather than
showing the department head entity symbol on the context diagram, the input data flow from the payroll department should be expanded
and called PAY DETAIL.
• State and federal reporting requirements differ, so they should be treated as two separate entities. Also, periodic changes in
GOVERNMENT TAX RATES should be shown as inputs to the payroll system.
• All ACCOUNTING REPORTS, except for an OVERALL FINANCIAL SUMMARY, should be distributed to the Accounting Department
instead of to the Finance Department. The accounting department also should receive a copy of the PAYROLL REPORT.
• The bank returns CLEARED PAYROLL CHECKS to the payroll department once a month. Amy reminded the analysts that the payroll
system handles the reconciliation of payroll checks.

Basis for Prioritisation
• Business Value
• Business or Technical Risk
– High risk first? So if it fails, it fails early …
– Low risk first? Ensures early wins …

• Implementation Difficulty
• Likelihood of Success
• Regulation or Policy Compliance
• Relationship to other Requirements
• Urgency

– Could have: desirable but not necessary.

– Won’t have: not needed now, maybe later

Determine Solution Approach
• A ‘solution approach’ describes the general approach
taken to acquire new capabilities to meet the
business need
1. Identify possible approaches
2. Determine the means by which a solution may be
delivered (incl. method and lifecycle)
3. Assess whether the organisation is capable of effectively
implementing and using a solution of that kind

32

Determine Solution Approach
• Possible Approaches
– Utilise existing services, infrastructure, software,
hardware etc. available to the organisation
– Design and develop custom application
– Purchase COTS (commercial off-the-shelf)
– Make organisational changes
– Change business processes
– Outsource
– Partner with suppliers to deliver capability
– Training programmes

Assess Organisational Readiness
• Assess whether the organisation is ready to make
effective use of the solution
– describe the effect and impact of a solution on the
organisation
– Consider the changes, their effects on the targeted
business area and other parts of the business (and
externally)
– Effective communication of impacts helps to enable
organisational change management

• Two aspects:
– Ability: access to new capabilities (operational)
– Willingness: desire for change (cultural)

Transition Requirements
• Requirements for the capabilities needed to
transition from an existing solution to a new solution
– The transition to a new solution can take time. Both old
and new systems may have to operate simultaneously.
– As well as necessary training in the new solution, other
transition requirements may be needed temporarily
– The lifecycle of transition requirements is managed in the
same way as other requirements

Business Analysis (IAB204)

41

Transition Activities
• Data

– Data and metadata are evaluated to identify whether to
archive, cleanse or move to new solution
– Business rules checked to see that converted data is
correctly interpreted

• Ongoing Work

– Managing ongoing work during solution development and
transition needs consideration
• i.e. cutover strategy

• Org Change

– BA may be involved in the chg mgt processes – skills
development and communication of change are common
tasks
