Solution Evaluation
• Solution Evaluation includes the processes to validate a full solution or a
segment of a solution that is about to be or has already been implemented.
• Evaluation determines how well a solution meets the business needs expressed
by stakeholders, including delivering value to the customer.

Enable Organizational Transition

Purpose:
Build confidence that the
organization is ready for
the transition and
demonstrate how it will
transition from the
current state to the future
state by integrating the
solution or partial
solution into operations.

Transition
Requirements:
• Temporary capabilities
needed for transition
(e.g., data conversion,
training, operational
changes).
• Discovered during
modelling, definition, and
elaboration of product
requirements.

Transition Approach:
• Systematic, disciplined
review to ensure all
transition requirements
and related activities are
completed.
• Includes
communications,
training, procedural
updates, data
conversion, and
necessary
documentation.

Readiness Assessment:
• Conducted based on the
readiness assessment plan to
verify that transition
requirements are met prior to
release.
• Identifies gaps that need
corrective actions.
• Iterative assessments to
ensure the organization,
team, process, system, and
product are prepared for the
transition and operation of the
solution.

Assess Organisational Readiness
• An estimated 50% of all change efforts fail due to
insufficient assessment of readiness to change
• Two aspects:
– Ability: access to new capabilities
– Willingness: desire for change

Assess Organisational Readiness
• Assess whether the organisation is ready to make
effective use of the solution
– describe the effect and impact of a solution on the
organisation
– Consider the changes, their effects on the targeted business
area and other parts of the business (and externally)
– Effective communication of impacts helps to enable
organisational change management

Assess Organisational Readiness
• Operational / Technical Assessment

– Is the organisation able to take advantage of the capabilities of the solution?
– Has training been planned?
– Have policies and procedures been defined?
– Is the solution able to perform at the required level?
– Are support mechanisms in place?

• Cultural assessment
– Determine whether stakeholder groups want the change to be successful
– Assess the beliefs, attitudes and feelings of groups
– Determine whether stakeholders understand why the solution is required

1. Woolworth's Australia: The death of institutional memory
The Australian outpost of the venerable department store chain, affectionately known as "Woolies,"
also ran into data-related problems as it transitioned from a system built 30 years ago in-house to
SAP. One of the biggest crises that arose was that profit-and-loss reports tailored for individual stores,
which managers were accustomed to receiving every week, couldn't be generated for nearly 18 month
s.
The problem lay in the change in data collection procedures, but the root cause was a failure of the
business to fully understand its own processes. The day-to-day business procedures weren't properly
documented, and as senior staff left the company over the too-long six-year transition process, all that
institutional knowledge was lost — and wasn't able to be baked into the new rollout.
"I often see companies that don’t take the people who really know business processes and dedicate
them to the ERP rollout”. "They make it a part-time job, or they hire new people to tell the system guys
what to build. None of that works. You have to really dedicate the people who know the process that
you’re trying to get right, full-time. And it’s a common theme that, when you don’t dedicate those
people, you get into trouble.“ (Greg Crouse, Managing Director at Navigant Consulting)

2. Vodafone: The long arm of the law
When British telecom provider Vodafone consolidated its
CRM systems onto a Siebel platform, they ran into
problems: not all the customer accounts migrated properly.
The company didn't go out of its way to advertise this, of
course, but people started to notice when their accounts
weren't properly credited for payments made. The upshot: a
£4.6 million fine from the British telecom regulator.

3. HP's "perfect storm" of ERP problems
HP's "perfect storm" of ERP problems

The epic tale of HP's centralization of its disparate North American
ERP systems onto one SAP system proves that one can never be too p
essimistic when it comes to ERP project management. You see, in
2004, HP's project managers knew all of the things that could go
wrong with their ERP rollout. But they just didn't plan for so many of
them to happen at once.
The project eventually cost HP $160 million in order backlogs and lost
revenue—more than five times the project's estimated cost. "We had a
series of small problems, none of which individually would have been
too much to handle. But together they created the perfect storm.
(Gilles
Bouchard, then-CIO of HP's global operations)

•

– Significant over- or under-performance may be investigated to
determine a root cause or response
– If under-performance is controllable, the cause may become a

– Over-performance needs similar investigation and review

Replacement or Elimination
•

If the solution or component no longer supports the goals of the
organisation

•

Issues influencing the replacement / elimination decision may include:
– Whole-of-life costing (Total Cost of Ownership) calculations
– Opportunity cost: the potential value that could be realised by pursuing
alternative courses of action
– Necessity: e.g., support for the system no longer exists
– Sunk cost: irrelevant when considering future actions; sometimes
psychologically represents a ‘commitment’ to continue to avoid wasting past
monies spent.
