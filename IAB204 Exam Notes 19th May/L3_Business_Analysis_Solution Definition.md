Define the Solution
• Synthesizing information from the business value assessment to support solution
selection.
• Developing decision packages that include business cases, product roadmaps,
high-level solution scopes, and benefits realization plans.
• Value of Defining the Solution
• Ensures the right solution is implemented by validating feasibility and
promoting the best course of action.
• Provides alternatives to anticipate objections and manage stakeholder
expectations.
• Develops comprehensive business cases and roadmaps to guide
implementation and manage expectations.

How to Define the Solution
1. Determine solution options using prioritization and categorization
techniques.
2. For each potential option, perform an analysis to identify assumptions,
constraints, risks, dependencies, intended benefits, and disbenefits
related to those options.
3. Assess the viability and feasibility of each option.
4. Assemble the business case by collecting information from the business
value assessment.
5. Engage the team to determine the solution approach and develop a
roadmap for deployment.

Idea Generation Techniques:
Metaphorical Excursion
• A metaphor is a thinking technique
connecting two different universes
of meaning, i.e.
• Feels like Heaven
• Flow of Time
• Fiscal Watchdog
• Iron Fist

• They key to metaphorical thinking
is “similarity”. The human mind
tends to look for similarities .

Prioritisation Challenges
• Prioritisation is a negotiated process
• Not everyone wants to or
knows how to negotiate
• Stakeholders
• Avoid difficult decisions
• Fail to recognise the need for
trade-offs
• Rank everything too high
• Technical staff
• May influence priorities through
misleading advice about
difficulty of implementation

Questions for Stakeholders
• If this requirement were omitted, what
are the consequences to the business
objectives?
• Is there an existing system or process
that can meet this requirement?
• Why can’t this requirement be deferred
to the next release?
• What is the business risk of not
implementing this requirement right
away?

Prioritisation Techniques: Timeboxing/Budgeting
•

Time and money are usually fixed resources for
delivering a solution

•

Methods: estimate time and budget for solution
elements:
– ALL IN – start with everything and then exclude
requirements until time / budget limits are met
– ALL OUT – add requirements until time /
budget limits are met
– SELECTIVE – add requirements in order
of priority based on other factors until time
/ budget limits are met

Prioritisation Techniques: Buy-a-Feature Game
1. Feature List and Pricing: List potential features with price tags reflecting their
development costs.
2. Fake Money Voting: Stakeholders use fake money to vote on features. They must
collaborate since many features are too expensive to buy individually.
3. Discussion and Prioritization: Players discuss and negotiate to decide which
features to buy, focusing on what truly matters to customers.
4. Preparation: Add feature names, descriptions, and prices to a template. Set a
total budget (about half the total price of all features) and divide it among players.
5. Gameplay: Participants discuss and pool their money to buy features. Use tools
like timers and sticky notes to keep track of discussions and decisions.

Prioritisation Techniques: Combined Criteria Matrix
Example Scenario:
The Chemical Tracking System will let research scientists request containers of
chemicals to be supplied by the company’s chemical stockroom or by commercial
chemical vendors.
The system will store the location of every chemical container within the company,
the quantity of material remaining in it, and the complete history of each container’s
location and usage.
The Chemical Tracking System must also comply with federal and state government
regulations that require quarterly chemical usage, storage, and disposal reports.

Prioritisation Techniques: Decision Analysis (Example)
Deadpool Inc. is considering its options for a new handheld drill. The first
option is to purchase an advanced CAD system; the second option is to
employ several new design engineers to work on the project; and the third
option is not develop the drill at all. The cost of purchasing the CAD system
is $950,000, whilst hiring additional design engineers is $725,000. When
manufacturing without CAD, unit costs are $100, but when using CAD they
fall to $80. If the new product is favourably received by the market, its
expected that 50,000 units will be sold at $200 each. However, there is a
60% chance that the product will be less successful, in which case only
16,000 units are expected to be sold.
Calculate the expected monetary values for the three options.
