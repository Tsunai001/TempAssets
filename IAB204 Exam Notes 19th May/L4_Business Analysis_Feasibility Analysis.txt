Financial Feasibility

Assessing Feasibility

High-level financial feasibility

Operational Feasibility

Technical Feasibility

• Estimate of costs and benefits

Does the required technology &
skills exist

What is the upfront cost of the option

How well the business need
is met

What are its running costs

How receptive the
organisation is to change

If not, can it be feasibly acquired
How do they compare to expected benefits

How well the change can
be sustained

How well are non-functional
requirements met
• Security, reliability, maintainability, etc.

Are the proposed changes
compatible with existing
infrastructure & interfaces

Does the organisation have the
technical expertise to install and
operate the solution

Can that level of funding be obtained

Is the anticipated value of the benefits greater than
projected costs of development? (cost / benefit
analysis)
Does the organisation have adequate cash flow to
fund the project during the development period?

Preparing a Business Case
Helps organisations select the best projects
to meet business needs
• Assessed in a consistent manner
Projects are occasionally approved without a
business case
• Competition, govt/legal mandates, executive inclination
Recommendation
• Feasibility analysis of each option
• Assumptions, constraints, risks, dependencies
• Ranking of options
• Explanation of why recommendation was chosen
• Cost-benefit analysis of recommendation
• Implementation approach
• Milestones, phases, roles, responsibilities
• Post-implementation evaluation ( Benefit Realization)

Cost Analysis-Example
• The cost analysis is an important activity that is designed to assess the costs
associated with a solution.
• This process begins by analysing all the expenses of the project including direct and
indirect (operational overheads).

Financial Feasibility; Cost Classifications
Tangible costs

•

•
•

costs for which you can assign a specific
dollar value
Example :
• employee salaries
• hardware and software purchases
• office supplies

Intangible costs

•

•
•

•

Direct costs

•

costs whose dollar value cannot be
calculated easily
Example :
•
customer dissatisfaction
•
lowered employee morale
•
reduced information availability

Developmental costs
•
•

costs that can be associated with
the development of a specific
system
Example :
• salaries of project team
members
• purchase of hardware

•

•

•

•

Indirect costs
•

•

overhead expenses / costs that cannot
be attributed to the development of a
specific system
Example :
• salaries of network administrators
• machine rentals
• insurance expenses

costs that are incurred only once at the time the system is
developed or acquired
Example :
• salaries of people involved in system development
• software purchases
• initial user training
• purchase of necessary hardware or furniture

•

Fixed costs
•

•

•

costs that are relatively constant
and do not depend on a level of
activity or effort
Example :
• salaries
• hardware rentals

Variable costs
•
•

costs that vary depending on the level of
activity
Example :
• printer paper
• supplies
• telephone line charges

Operational costs
•
costs that are incurred after the system is implemented
and continue while system is in use
•
Example :
•
system maintenance
•
ongoing training
•
annual software license fee
•
communications expenses

Uniform Cash Flows
•

A coffee shop is looking to purchase an additional
espresso machine:
– Cost: $20,000
– Estimated net cash flow: $4,000 per year.
–

•

An alternate idea is to refurbish the shop:
– Cost: $30,000
– Estimated net cash flow: $6,500 per year.
–

•

PBP for this investment is 5 years.

PBP for this investment is 4 years 7 months.

If the shop can only afford one investment and only used PBP
as the basis for the decision, it would refurbish, since the
payback period is shorter.

Advantages:
• Easy to calculate
• Measure of inherent risk
• Ranks highly projects that
would return investment
early

Consider two projects, each with a five-year life
and each costing $6,000.

Disadvantages:
• Ignores the time value of
money
• Ignores cash flows after the
payback period.
• Unacceptable for projects
with long lives where time

Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) Methods: Net Present Value (NPV)
Future expected benefits
expressed in the value of
those benefits at the time of
investment

NPV is one of the most reliable
measures used in budgeting
because it accounts for time value
of money by using discounted
cash flows in the calculation

• e.g., invest $1000 @ 10% p.a. =
$1100 in a year. So $1100 future
value has a present value of $1000

Takes into account current
and future benefits, inflation,
opportunity costs

Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) Methods: Net Present Value (NPV)

Advantages
• Accounts for time value of money
• Better estimates than IRR (in most cases)

Disadvantages
• Is still an estimate (sensitive to changes)
• Doesn’t take into account project size:
• e.g. Project A costs $4m to bring NPV of $1m, while Project B
costs $2m to bring NPV of $0.8m. A has higher NPV, but B
has higher ROI

IRR is essentially the interest rate that makes

• Higher IRR is better

Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) Methods: Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
Advantages
• IRR is uniform for investments of varying types
• Can be used to rank multiple prospective projects on a relatively even
basis.
• project with the highest IRR probably best

Disadvantages
• Can be misleading if used alone
• a project may have a low IRR but a high NPV, so returns may be slow
but will add high overall value
• Can mislead if comparing projects of different timespans
