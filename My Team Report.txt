# PART A

## Introduction

At Volt Typhoon, a medium-sized restaurant in the Accommodation & Hospitality Industry, technology is central to its operations. To ensure its continued success, the management has tasked us, the team at Cyber Securitus, with assessing the cyber security risks associated with one of its most important assets: a mobile device used across the organisation. This report is a critical step in protecting the organisation’s sensitive data and ensuring daily operations run smooth.

The mobile device is a Lenovo Yoga 7i 2-in-1 Gen 9 (14"), which is essential to Volt Typhoon’s workflow and overall business management. It is used by staff and management for tasks such as booking tables, managing inventory, accessing proprietary recipes, and facilitating communication. It contains sensitive business data, including customer records, financial details, and operational documents, as well as some personal data. Since this device is also permitted for personal use on-site, the risks are even greater—any compromise could lead to the exposure of confidential information, potentially damaging the restaurant’s reputation, and/or disrupting operations in the process. Our responsibility is to help Volt Typhoon mitigate these risks.

Further in this report we will touch on some of the vulnerabilities identified on the device and the go into detail with flaws in configuration and usage. For instance, there are outdated security patches, disabled firewall protection on public networks, and inconsistent account management practices. Combined with the collective use-case of the device, these issues significantly increase the chances of a cyber security incident. Addressing these risks will be essential for Volt Typhoon to maintain its competitive edge and to maintain the trust of its customers and the integrity of its practices going forward.

In this report, we will also analyse additional risks, identify potential threats, and provide practical recommendations to reduce them. While we are focusing on this specific mobile device, the strategies we propose will still be tangible and tailored to Volt Typhoon’s needs. We have made a few assumptions about how the device is used, based on information provided and deduced from our troubleshooting and light auditing, and these assumptions will be the basis of our analysis.

By the end of this report, we aim to equip Volt Typhoon with the tools and understanding needed to strengthen its cyber security and protect its critical assets for the near future, while reinforcing the need for healthy cyber security practices moving forward. Together, we will ensure the organisation continues to thrive in a digital world increasingly at risk of vulnerability.

Below is our analysis of possible threats that could act on the potential vulnerabilities within Volt Typhoon, as identified by our team:

**Confidentiality:**

Company secrets or critical employee information are the most at risk. For example, the manager’s personal email being used on a device configured for work-related matters is an easily exploitable vulnerability, such that any unauthorised users would be able to view not just confidential information like secret recipes and ingredients and even company data and analytics, but also the Manager’s private information and emails, which could be used to access other information maliciously.

User login details of employees located within screenshots inside the Manager’s OneDrive would also be very susceptible to leakage for similar reasons, since the OneDrive is also accessible from the same device, employees’ sensitive data such as bank numbers and personal details can be collected without much difficulty if the OneDrive is not protected.

**Integrity:**

If assets are accessed by an unauthorised person, or accidentally by a random employee using the device, it becomes easy to edit or delete information stored inside the relevant files and documents. Company information such as financial data, marketing assets and inventory being altered in any way can cause significant issues with external parties collaborating with the company, such as complications with suppliers and vendors, and losing the trust of stakeholders that have invested in the company.

Employee data can also be accessed, either by external parties or even employees themselves, for example, disgruntled workers who wish to destroy company property in an act of “payback.” Changes to recipes, such as editing ingredient quantities or steps in the recipe, can affect the quality of food being served to customers, and subsequently lead to damage to reputation as loyal customers may stop eating at the restaurant.

**Availability:**

Adding on to affecting the integrity of the company’s assets, there is also threat to the availability of said assets. For example, if the restaurant is to employ menus and services that need to be viewed from a website, if the menu database or website were to go down, customers may not be able to view the menu or make orders online.

Access to the mobile device itself can be compromised, if any of the devices are not well maintained or updated frequently – become unusable for employees or staff during work hours in the event of a breakdown or software update.

The applications that would be used by a restaurant manager on a Yoga 7i Gen 9 given the usage restrictions would primarily include personal applications, in addition to operational and administrative tools.

Understanding that the most popular personal app categories include tools, communication, social, media, games, shopping and finance ( [Ceci, 2023](#Ceci)) and has a relatively high-risk if compromised. and has a relatively high-risk if compromised. -risk if compromised. -risk if compromised. -risk if compromised. -risk if compromised. -risk if compromised.

Specifically, web browsers contain browser history, URL cache, stored usernames and passwords, bookmarks, download history, and cookies ([Medium, 2019](#Medium)). As for messaging platforms and social networking services such as Meta, the user’s contacts, conversations, diagnostic data, coarse location, contact information, and user engagement metrics are typically stored ([Smith, 2021](#Smith)). Digital banking includes information like the user’s transaction history, account details, personal identification, and inherence-based and knowledge-based authentication data. Ecommerce includes delivery addresses, payment data, user engagement metrics, and purchase history. Lastly, system enhancement tools contain data like device health and storage, network traffic and configuration, and device usage data.

Other genres of personal applications that would likely be less frequently used by a restaurant manager include education, games, and navigation applications.

As part of their operational and administrative goals, restaurant managers would frequently use a range of tools at least once a week to ensure an optimised workflow. These include a point of sale (POS) system, inventory management, performance analytics, employee scheduling, reservation management, online ordering platforms, customer relationship management (CRM) financial management, and business communication tools.

The first three tools- POS system, inventory management and performance analytics- are typically combined into one application. For restaurants, this includes applications such as Toast and Square, which store personal details, financial data, preference data, device information, cookies, and aggregated data [(TOAST, 2023](#TOAST)). As for employee scheduling, Deputy and Sling are some examples, which store user identity attributes, availability constraints, attendance times and locations, performance data, user banking details, and financial compensation ([Deputy Trust Team, 2024](#Deputy)). Reservation management, CRM, and online ordering platforms can be integrated into one application, such as the case with Seven rooms and open table, which collect online activity data, user location, transactional data, and account data ([SevenRooms INC.](#SevenRooms) 2023). As for financial management, applications like Xero store payment data, account data, authentication data, marketing data, device information, and user generated input ([Xero, 2025](#Xero)). Lastly, business communication applications such as Slack, Microsoft 365, Asana, and Zoom all collect metadata, communication content, account data, authentication data, and behavioural data.

As for less frequently used applications that would still be applied in a professional setting, these would include storage applications for operational documents and standard operating procedures (SOPs), marketing applications for temporary promotions, and hiring applications such as indeed, LinkedIn, and seek.

### Risk Identification and Analysis

Use the template supplied and provide a summary for each of the three requested items, along with your analysis of the associated risks.

- Identify and analyse risks associated with the use of this mobile device.
- Now that the context has been established, you and your team need to identify some security issues related to the device discussed in the context. These security issues can be found by searching the publicly available literature and MUST be published recently. These articles do not need to be from academic journals, however, should be from credible sources.
- We suggest you find articles from IT security news and reputable security blogs, or industry whitepapers for this section of your report. Think about some of the sources you have accessed for information in the weekly Learning Materials, or in the tutorial question sets.
- You will need to locate three articles, with ONE article relating to each of the following:

1. _software - the mobile device operating system_ **_or_** _an application installed on the device._
2. _user behaviour_
3. _physical threats to mobile devices_

- Summarise the reported issue providing details on information security aspects such as the associated threats, vulnerabilities, consequences, and impact.
- NOTE: It is important to use recent articles – the publication date should be no earlier than April 2024. Use of articles published before this date will significantly reduce your marks. The event described may have occurred earlier, but the publication date should be on or after April 1, 2024.

**_Useful tips_**

**_For choosing articles:_**

_You need to select three different articles to inform your report. The article selection is crucial to your ability to discuss risks appropriately. This is part of risk communication and should have relevance for the client organisation. Be prepared to spend some time considering a range of articles before selecting the three your team will use. Here are some things to consider for the different types of articles:_

**_Software (Operating system or Application) Articles:_**

- State clearly whether the vulnerability is in the operating system, or within an installed application. It must be a real software product, not a hypothetical scenario.
- If it is an operating system vulnerability - check that the vulnerability does manifest itself within the operating system running on the user’s device.
- If it is an application vulnerability, check:
  - Does the vulnerability manifest itself within the application running on the user’s device and NOT the operating system itself?
  - Does the vulnerability manifest itself within the application running on the user’s device and NOT the operating system or backend of the application. For example, a vulnerable API endpoint is NOT in the application and would be difficult for the organisation to treat as they cannot control it.

**_User Behaviour:_**

- Does the vulnerability manifest itself due to the user of the device DOING or NOT DOING something - rather than it being a technology-based issue?

**_Physical Threats:_**

- Does the vulnerability manifest itself in a physical (real-world) manner?
- Does the threat contain a physical (real-world) component as part of its description?
- Does the threat/vulnerability impact the security of the asset? Consider the CIA triad. For example, a known hardware fault in the mobile device can only impact availability, which makes treating the risk in Part B more challenging.

_If your answer to any of the above questions is NO, choose another article. If it is UNCLEAR, please consider choosing another article._

_NOTE: Your discussion needs to specifically discuss how your article relates to the established context (From Phase 2). If it does not, your marks may be reduced, and the markers may provide feedback suggesting that the article your team selected should be replaced for Part B._

_If you cannot find articles that match the device from your context, consider other aspects that might help to relate the article content to the context. Is it a different device, but uses the same operating system? Is there an earlier version that had a vulnerability? You might consider adjusting the context you described to include specific issues you have found interesting articles about._

**_For writing about the articles:_**

- Make sure that the articles you chose are related to your context. For example,
  - When you described the context, make sure the application you chose is mentioned as being installed on the user’s device, and that it being installed makes sense for that user in that organisation. Double-check that the application appears in your software list.
  - Make sure the operating system issue you discuss is for the operating system in the context. Consider the version of the operating system that your user may have installed - it may not be the latest version.
- When discussing the threat, vulnerability and security incident/attack ensure you are very specific and careful with your use of terminology.
  - In these sections, short concise descriptions are recommended, as long sections of text often demonstrate that you have these concepts mixed up. Refer to the relevant lecture context to be sure you are using the appropriate terminology.

### Privacy Impact Analysis

- Chosen: **Meta Facebook messenger** – large privacy policy and history of privacy violations (5 bill)

_For an application that you noted in the context as installed in the mobile device under consideration,_ **_locate_** _and summarise the associated privacy policy. This must be a real application with a real privacy policy, not a hypothetical application._

**_NOTE:_** _You only need to do this for ONE application, NOT for all the applications on the device._

_In addition to summarising the privacy policy, you need to identify at least one risk for the organisation that is associated with the use of this application._

_Importantly, these risks need to be directly related to the use of the application based on information you obtained from the privacy policy, NOT what-if scenarios (e.g., A data breach). The identified risks should be relevant for the context you establish at the beginning of the report._

- The name of the application
- The type of information the app collects
- How the information is collected

- When the information is collected (only when you are actively using the app, or at other times; if so, provide details)

- How relevant the collected information is to the user’s purpose in using the app.

- How is this connected to user privacy? How closely does the app privacy policy meet the requirements of Australian privacy legislation?

The Meta privacy policy is used for a wide range of applications including Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp, and Messenger. In this privacy policy, there are various types of data that are collected from users that is either used internally at Meta or shared with third parties. Each data type will be analysed regarding how the data is collected, stored, encrypted, and secured. Additionally, the relevancy of the data and how Meta utilises that data will also be explored, with consideration into how these practices align with Australian privacy legislation.

#### Privacy Risk Identification \[Nick\]

## Risk Evaluation and Prioritisation for Treatment  

\[Unassigned\]

_Now you need to evaluate these risks, considering the organisation's risk appetite and risk criteria, to determine if they require treatment, and if so, with what priority._

_In this phase, relate the risks discussed in the previous phases to the client organisation. As part of your evaluation, for each of the risks you have identified occurring within the client organisation perform risk evaluation: that is, consider the consequence and likelihood for these incidents to occur in your specific context, and describe the impact that this risk event could have on the client organisation._

_How to write about this in your Risk report: Required details and useful tips_

_Risk Evaluation (1-2 Pages)_

- _For each of the identified risks (those associated with the three selected articles and the privacy policy you analysed), perform an analysis that considers consequence and likelihood._
  - _Which assets are most at risk – and for what sort of harm?_
  - _If the asset is harmed, what would the impact be, on the device user and on the organisation? Are there any other stakeholders to consider?_
  - _Which sort of analysis can you perform – quantitative or qualitative? Justify your choice._
  - _For the type of analysis you perform, include the scale that you are measuring against for consequence and likelihood, and how these will be combined to determine risk._
- _Perform the risk analysis._
- _Based on the above analysis, and the established context, determine which of the identified risks require treatment, and with what priority (Justify your choices)._

**_Useful Tips_**

- _You only need to discuss risks that you have identified in the earlier phases. This part of the report should not contain new risks that you create. As a result, it should contain an evaluation of:_
  - _the risks based on your analysis of the three articles, as well as_
  - _1-2 risks you identified from the consideration of the privacy policy._
- _Make sure you justify your choices throughout this section. For example, if you perform quantitative analysis, discuss why you are performing this type of analysis._
  - **_Note:_** _make sure you perform the analysis and do not just say which type you should use._
- _If you are unsure how to combine likelihood and consequence into an overall risk level, refer to Lecture 3 Part A. If you are using a risk matrix to calculate a risk level, this matrix should be included and cited appropriately._

_While you might consider all the risks as requiring treatment, it is not practical to assign them all the same priority, or to say they all need treatment urgently. Imagine you are giving this report to the client organisation. Their team will subsequently allocate resources to try to treat these risks, so they need to know which risk to address first, and then second, etc._

_\[The risk treatment itself will be addressed in Part B of your report. You do not need to discuss risk treatment options in Part A.\]_

# PART B

## Risk Treatment and Countermeasures

_Identify and discuss control measures to mitigate each of the security issues you identified in your Report Part A_

_In this phase, your team need to identify and discuss control measures to mitigate each of the security issues you identified in Phase 3 (Risk assessment) and Phase 4 (Privacy analysis) and evaluated and prioritised for treatment in Phase 5. The selected control measures should be suitable for the scenario described in the original article._

_This must be substantiated by reference to appropriate literature. Do not just make this up. Search the publicly available literature for sources that describe certain control measures and support the effectiveness of control measures in addressing the identified risks. If a control addresses multiple risks, identify these risks._

_Record the reference details for the control measure and use in-text citation to connect the content in your report to the reference._

_Note: the control measure reference material need not be recently published, and they do not need to be from academic journals. However, they should be from credible sources. We suggest you find articles from reputable organisations (some Australian security organisations we have mentioned in the learning materials include ACSC, ASD, ...), IT security news and reputable security blogs, or industry whitepapers for this section of your report._

_Be sure that you have clearly identified at least one control measure to mitigate each of the risks you included in Phase 5, associated with:_

- _the mobile device software (application or operating system)_
- _user behaviour_
- _physical threats to mobile devices, and_
- _user privacy revealed in your app privacy policy review and analysis._

_As you consider the options available for the risks you are attempting to address the four options for treating risk:_

- Risk avoidance
- Risk modification
- Risk sharing
- Risk retention

_categorised controls based on:_

- _the approach taken: does it involve technology, policy and process, or people - requiring user education, training, and awareness, and_
- _the role they play preventive, detective, or corrective._

_You should be able to determine the applicable categories for the controls that you identify to address the prioritised risks._

**_How to write about this in your Risk Report:_**

_required details and useful tips._

_Use the following Control Measure template for each of the risk treatment summaries you include in this section of your report._

_Control Measure Template (1 page per identified risk)_

_Overview of security issue discussed, and risk identified in Part A
Give a really brief (one paragraph) summary of the security issue you discussed previously here. Be sure to include the security goals (CIA) compromised (look for the marker’s feedback on Part A and correct this if you need to)._

_NOTE: If you did not complete Part A of your report previously, or your team chose an old or irrelevant article in Part A, you can choose a new article and add or replace the earlier sections in this Part B report - but do include a note for the marker to let them know you’ve done this._

_Treating the risk_

_Suggested control measure and explanation  
Choose a control measure for the risk you described in your previous submission. There may be a few different options, so pick the one you think is most effective - unless you have already used that type of control for a previous risk treatment. Try to keep your explanation reasonably non-technical._

- _Your explanation should include:_
  - _What the control measure is, and how it works._
  - _Whether the control measure is preventive, detective, or corrective._
  - _An estimate of the degree of protection this control provides for the asset, and how this is obtained. For example, does it reduce the likelihood or the consequence of an incident? How much of a reduction?_
  - _A statement of any limitations or other impact. (For example, on efficiency, battery power, user experience, whether the measure requires technical competence on the part of the device user, or requires vendor action, or ...?)_

**Useful Tips**

- You only need to discuss treatments for risks that you have identified and prioritised in your Part A report. This part of the report should not contain new risks that you create, or treatments for risks that have not been mentioned in Part A.
- Make sure you justify your choices throughout this section. For example, if you categorise a treatment measure as preventive, be clear about what it prevents and how. If you categorise a treatment measure as technology based, justify that categorisation.
- Relate the treatment measures to the client organisation. While you might consider all the risks as requiring treatment, the client organisation may not have the resources or capability for all treatment options. Think about the cost (in $$ and time) and the expertise that may be required to implement these treatments. Does that limit the choices?

## Recommendations

_After discussing treatment options to address the various risks identified in Part A, including the degree of protection provided and the limitations associated with certain control measures, what are the specific actions that you recommend your client organisation take?_

_Make a list of the controls that you recommend be applied and the priority for these actions, to treat the identified risks associated with the use of the mobile device._

_When choosing your recommendations, you should consider the various costs involved, such as time, money, and personnel. If possible, include approximate values for initial and ongoing costs in your report._

_The client organisation may want to address all of the identified risks, but it is not practical to expect that everything will be addressed immediately. Therefore, you should include an approximate timeline for implementing your recommendations. The timeline should also be practical for the organisation to implement, considering internal/external resources and the priority you assigned the risks from Part A of the report. For example, it is impractical for a small organisation to deploy software to hundreds of self-managed devices within a week._

**_Useful Tips_**

- _Recommended controls should include people, policy and process and technology. That is, some controls will involve humans (for example: user awareness training), some will be policies to be established and processes to be applied, and some will be technical._
  - _Although this is a report for a client, in academic terms it is an opportunity to demonstrate the breadth of the information security knowledge of your team (how much of the IFB240 content do you/your team understand and can apply?)._
- _Be sure to explain why the controls you recommend are relevant in this context for this client organisation. The appropriate choices are often dependent on aspects of the context. Do not just list controls and expect the client (or marker) to figure out the relevance. Make it explicit._
